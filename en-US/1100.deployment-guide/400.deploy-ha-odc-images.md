# Deploy ODC in high-availability mode

## Load and run an ODC image

After you initialize the MetaDB of OceanBase Developer Center (ODC), you need to obtain and run the ODC image on each node to install ODC.

### Load the image

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>The images of ODC V4.2.0 and later versions have been published to Docker Hub. If your local device running ODC can access Docker Hub, you can directly start ODC Docker without downloading the image. For details, see the <strong>Running Image</code> content below.</li>
  <li>If Docker Hub cannot be accessed directly, you still need to download and load the image file.</li>
  </ul>
</main>

To obtain the ODC image on the host, select the required image from the following list and click **Download** .

* Image for X86: [Download](https://obodc-front.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/ODC4.3.1-bp1/obodc4.3.1-bp1.tar.gz)

* Image for ARM: [Download](https://obodc-front.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/ODC4.3.1-bp1/obodc4.3.1-bp1_arm.tar.gz)

After you obtain the image, run the following command in the command-line tool to load it:

```javascript
gunzip -c obodc-{$version}.tar.gz  docker load
```

### Run the image

Execute the following sample statement in the command-line tool to run the image:

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env bash
docker run -v /var/log/odc:/opt/odc/log -v /var/data/odc:/opt/odc/data \
-d -i --net host --cpu-period 100000 --cpu-quota 400000 --memory 8G --name "obodc" \
-e "DATABASE_HOST=xxx.xx.xx.xx" \
-e "DATABASE_PORT=60805" \
-e "DATABASE_USERNAME=db_user@tenant_name#cluster_name" \
-e "DATABASE_PASSWORD=******" \
-e "DATABASE_NAME=odc_metadb" \
-e "ODC_PROFILE_MODE=alipay" \
-e "ODC_ADMIN_INITIAL_PASSWORD=******" \
oceanbase/odc:4.2.2
```

The following table describes parameters used in the preceding sample statement.

|         Parameter |  Description   |
|------------------------------------|------------------------|
| -v                                       | <ul><li>Maps the `/var/log/odc` directory of the host to the `/opt/odc/log` directory in the ODC container.  If the `/var/log/odc` directory does not exist on the host, run the `mkdir -p /var/log/odc` command to create one. </li><li>Mounts the `/var/data/odc` directory of the host to the `/opt/odc/data` directory in the ODC container.  If the `/var/data/odc` directory does not exist on the host, run the `mkdir -p /var/data/odc` command to create one.</li></ul>   |
| --net                                    | The network configuration of the Docker container. If you set this parameter to `host`, the host network is directly used.  You can also use the `--publish` (`-p`) parameter to configure port mapping. However, the Docker container may fail to start in some circumstances due to incorrect DNS resolution in the Docker container. In this case, run the `--net host` command to start the Docker container.  |
| --cpu-period --cpu-quota | * The `---cpu-period` parameter specifies the interval at which the CPU cores of the Docker container are reallocated. Unit: microseconds.   * The `---cpu-quota` parameter specifies the maximum time for running the current Docker container in this interval. Unit: microseconds.    You can use these two parameters in combination to specify the number of CPU cores that the Docker container uses. The value is calculated by dividing cpu-quota by cpu-period. In the preceding sample statement, the values of cpu-quota and cpu-period are respectively 400000 and 100000, indicating that the Docker container can use at most four CPU cores. |
| --memory                                 | The maximum memory size for the Docker container.  |
| --name                                   | The name of the container. |
| DATABASE_HOST                            | The IP address of the MetaDB.  |
| DATABASE_PORT                            | The port number of the MetaDB.   |
| DATABASE_USERNAME                        | The username of the MetaDB. In OceanBase Database, the username is given in the db_user@tenant_name#cluster_name format. |
| DATABASE_PASSWORD                        | The password for connecting to the database.   |
| DATABASE_NAME                            | The name of the MetaDB.    |
| ODC_PROFILE_MODE                         | The mode. Default value: `alipay`.   |
| ODC_ADMIN_INITIAL_PASSWORD               | Specify the initial password of the ODC administrator account.<blockquote>**Notice**</br>The initial password should contain at least 2 digits, 2 uppercase letters, 2 lowercase letters and 2 special characters (._+@#$%), with a length of 8~32 digits, and the password cannot contain spaces.</blockquote>|

In addition to the preceding parameters, you can also use the following parameters when running the image.

| Parameter       |                                Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| ODC_LOG_DIR           | The log directory. Default value: `/opt/odc/log`. |
| ODC_JVM_HEAP_OPTIONS  | The JVM memory configuration. Default value: `-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=60.0 -XX:InitialRAMPercentage=60.0`, indicating that 60% of the memory is used, and the JVM memory can be customized by specifying the parameter `ODC_JVM_HEAP_OPTIONS`. Example: `-Xmx2048m -Xms2048m`, indicating that the heap memory is set to 2G. |
| ODC_JVM_GC_OPTIONS    | The garbage collection (GC) strategy for JVM. Default value: `-XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+PrintAdaptiveSizePolicy -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps -XX:+PrintGCDateStamps -Xloggc:/opt/odc/log/gc.log -XX:+UseGCLogFileRotation -XX:GCLogFileSize=50M -XX:NumberOfGCLogFiles=5`.  |
| ODC_JVM_OOM_OPTIONS   | The OutOfMemory strategy for JVM. Default value: `-XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError`.   |
| ODC_JVM_EXTRA_OPTIONS | Other JVM parameters. By default, no parameter is specified.   |
| ODC_SERVER_PORT       | The HTTP listening port for ODC-Server. Default value: 8989.   |
| ODC_HOST              | The IP address of ODC, which can be used as the destination IP address for remote procedure calls in high-availability deployment scenarios.  |
| ODC_MAPPING_PORT    |
The port number of the ODC runtime to avoid the problem that the port number cannot be used due to the deployment environment. This parameter is suitable for port mapping when deploying ODC in Docker.  |
| ODC_APP_EXTRA_ARGS    | Other App parameters need to be specified. <br> For example, `--server.servlet.session.timeout=10m`, indicating that the Session period is 10 minutes. The default value is empty.  |

## Deploy SSL certificate

When you log on to Web ODC in a browser over HTTP for the first time, you will receive a message indicating that the connection is not secure. To ensure access security, you can deploy an SSL certificate to access ODC over HTTPS. You can apply for a CA certificate or configure an HTTPS self-signed certificate. If you do not want to access ODC over HTTPS, you can skip this step and directly deploy NGINX.

### Apply for a CA certificate

To apply for a CA certificate, we recommend that you purchase an SSL certificate and an SSL certificate service on Alibaba Cloud. For more information, see [SSL certificate](https://www.aliyun.com/product/cas).

In the intranet environment, you can consult your IT administrator for the procedure of applying for a CA certificate.

### Configure an SSL self-signed certificate

The ODC image package contains an executable file that can generate a certificate and private keys: generate-odc-ssl-certificate.sh. You can run this file on the host to generate a certificate. The self-signed certificate can implement encrypted communication. However, an OS does not trust a self-signed certificate by default. You can add the certificate to the **Trusted Root Certificate Authorities** in the browser to configure certificate trust.

The following code shows how to run the executable file. The value for `domain` must be consistent with the domain name used by your ODC. Otherwise, the browser considers that the certificate does not match the site.

```shell
$./generate-odc-ssl-certificate.sh
Enter your domain [www.example.com]:
Enter your province [Zhejiang]:
Enter your city [Hangzhou]:
Enter your company name [OceanBase]:
Enter your company unit name [DBA]:
generate certificate...

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1424 Jun  3 15:18 server.crt
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1708 Jun  3 15:18 server.key
```

The following code shows the content of the generate-odc-ssl-certificate.sh file. You can directly run the following command to generate a self-signed certificate.

```unknow
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# for generate self certificated ssl certificate files

echo try create directory '/etc/pki/nginx' if not exists...
sudo mkdir -p /etc/pki/nginx
cd /etc/pki/nginx || exit

    -subj "${SUBJ}"

echo "check generated files (use ls -l odcserver.*):"
ls -l odcserver.*
```

## Deploy the Nginx proxy

After you deploy the image of OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) on all nodes, you need to deploy an NGINX proxy on an ODC node to route your requests to applications on different nodes. To deploy the NGINX proxy, you need to obtain and run the NGINX image on one node, copy the configuration file locally, and then modify the file. After the modification, stop running the NGINX image and then restart it to apply the modified configuration file.

### Load the image

Select a node and load and run the NGINX image. You can use the following methods to load the NGINX image:

* Pull the image from the Docker warehouse on the host.

* Download the image package to a local device, copy the package to the host, and decompress the package.

#### Pull the image from the Docker warehouse

Ensure that Docker is installed on the host and the host has access to the Internet. Then, run the following command in the command-line tool to pull the NGINX image from the Docker warehouse:

```javascript
docker pull nginx
```

#### Copy the image package to the host and decompress the package

1. Ensure that Docker is installed on the host and the host has access to the Internet. Then, run the following command on the host to download the image package to a local device:

   ```unknow
   docker save nginx:latest | gzip - >nginx.tar.gz
   ```

2. Copy the image package to the host and run the following command to load the image:

   ```javascript
   gunzip -c nginx.tar.gz | docker load
   ```

### Configure the configuration file

Before you start running the NGINX image, you must modify settings of the configuration file. The ODC image package contains templates of the configuration file. You can copy a template to a local device and edit the configuration where necessary. The templates of the configuration file vary, depending on whether you have deployed a self-signed certificate. We recommend that you copy a template based on the deployment and modify the configuration where necessary.

#### Configure the configuration file that does not contain the self-signed certificate

Run the following command to copy the configuration file from the image package to the host for editing. You can customize the copy path as needed, and replace the tilde (\~) with the local path of the configuration file:

```javascript
docker cp -a <odc_image_name>:/opt/odc/conf/nginx.conf.template  ~/<conf_local_path>
```

The following code shows a template of the configuration file. We recommend that you pay attention to the content that requires changes based on the comments.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
   <h4>Note</h4>
   <ul>
   <li>You can modify the load balancing configurations to ensure a sufficient proxy server timeout. The modification takes effect after you restart the Nginx proxy. </li>
   <li>We recommend that you set the <code>proxy_connect_timeout</code> parameter to a value not longer than 75 seconds. For more information, see <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_connect_timeout">proxy_connect_timeout</a>. </li>
   <li>If you do not set the <code>proxy_next_upstream</code> parameter to <code>off</code>, the Nginx proxy will forward your requests to the next ODC node. In this case, you need to log on to ODC again, and cannot use features related to file upload and download, such as downloading the result set of an asynchronous task. </li>
   </ul>
</main>

### Start an image

After the configuration file is modified locally, run the following command in the command-line tool to restart the NGINX image. The tilde (\~) indicates the local path of the configuration file.

```shell
docker run --network host --name nginx -v ～/<conf_local_path>:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf -v /etc/pki/nginx/:/etc/pki/nginx/ -d nginx
```

The following table lists parameters in the statement.


|                    Parameter   |   Description |
|-----------------|--------------|
| --network host                                  | Specifies to use a network port of the host. You do not need to configure port mapping in this case.    If you do not want to directly use the port of the host, you can specify the mapping ports using the `-p` parameter. For example, `-p 8080:80` specifies to map port 8080 of the host to port 80 of the Docker container. Likewise, `-p 8443:443` specifies to map port 8443 of the host to port 443 of the Docker container. |
| --name nginx                                    | Sets the name of the container to nginx for easier management. You can use other names, for example, odc-nginx.  |
| -v \~/\<conf_local_path\>:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf | Mounts the Docker container to the specified directory of the host and maps the local files of the host to the Docker container.  `<conf_local_path>` specifies a local path of the configuration file on the host, and then maps the configuration file to the /etc/nginx/nginx.conf file in the Docker container.   |
| -v /etc/pki/nginx/:/etc/pki/nginx/              | Maps the /etc/pki/nginx/ path of the host to the /etc/pki/nginx/ path of the Docker container.  |
| -d nginx                                        | Specifies to run the Docker container in the background.    |
