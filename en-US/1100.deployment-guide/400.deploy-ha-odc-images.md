# Deploy ODC in high-availability mode

## Load and run an ODC image

After you initialize the MetaDB of OceanBase Developer Center (ODC), you need to obtain and run the ODC image on each node to install ODC.

### Load the image

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Images of ODC V4.2.0 and later have been released in Docker Hub. If the server where ODC runs can access Docker Hub, you do not need to download an image and can directly start ODC Docker. For more information, see the "<strong>Run the image</strong>" section in this topic. </li>
  <li>If the server where ODC runs cannot access Docker Hub, you need to download and load the image file. </li>
  </ul>
</main>

To load the ODC image to the host, determine the required image in the following list and click **\[Download\]**.

* Image for x86: [\[Download\]](https://obodc-front.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/ODC%204.2.2-bp1/obodc4.2.2-bp1.tar.gz)<br>

* Image for Arm: [\[Download\]](https://obodc-front.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/ODC%204.2.2-bp1/obodc4.2.2-bp1_arm.tar.gz)

After you obtain the image, run the following command in the command-line tool to load it:

```javascript
gunzip -c obodc-{$version}.tar.gz | docker load
```

### Run the image

Run a command in the command-line tool on the host to run the obtained ODC image. The sample command is as follows:

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env bash
docker run -v /var/log/odc:/opt/odc/log -v /var/data/odc:/opt/odc/data \
-d -i --net host --cpu-period 100000 --cpu-quota 400000 --memory 8G --name "obodc" \
-e "DATABASE_HOST=xxx.xx.xx.xx" \
-e "DATABASE_PORT=60805" \
-e "DATABASE_USERNAME=[username]@[tenant name]#[cluster name]" \
-e "DATABASE_PASSWORD=******" \
-e "DATABASE_NAME=odc_metadb" \
-e "ODC_PROFILE_MODE=alipay" \
-e "ODC_ADMIN_INITIAL_PASSWORD=******" \
oceanbase/odc:4.2.2
```

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
   <h4>Notice</h4>
   <p>In the Shell environment, you must enclose a string that contains special characters such as <code>!</code> and <code>$</code> with single quotation marks ('), for example, <code>DATABASE_PASSWORD='11111!'</code>. </p>
</main>

The following table describes the parameters.

| Parameter | Description |
|---------------------|----------------|
| -v | <ul><li>Maps the `/var/log/odc` directory of the host to the `/opt/odc/log` directory in the ODC container.  If the `/var/log/odc` directory does not exist on the host, run the `mkdir -p /var/log/odc` command to create one. </li><li>Maps the `/var/data/odc` directory of the host to the `/opt/odc/data` directory in the ODC container. If the `/var/data/odc` directory does not exist on the host, run the `mkdir -p /var/data/odc` command to create one. </li></ul> |
| --net | The network configuration of the Docker container. If you set this parameter to `host`, the host network is directly used.  You can also use the `--publish` (`-p`) parameter to configure port mapping. However, the Docker container may fail to start in some environments due to internal DNS resolution errors. In this case, specify `--net host` in the command to start the Docker container.  |
| --cpu-period --cpu-quota | <li> The `---cpu-period` parameter specifies the interval at which the CPU cores of the Docker container are reallocated. Unit: μs. </li>   <li> The `---cpu-quota` parameter specifies the maximum time for running the current Docker container in this interval. Unit: μs. </li>    You can use these two parameters in combination to specify the number of CPU cores that the Docker container uses. The value is calculated by dividing `cpu-quota` by `cpu-period`. In the preceding sample statement, the values of `cpu-quota` and `cpu-period` are respectively `400000` and `100000`. Therefore, the resulting value is `4`, indicating that the Docker container can use at most four CPU cores.  |
| --memory | The maximum memory size for the Docker container.  |
| --name | The name of the container.  |
| DATABASE_HOST | The IP address of the MetaDB.  |
| DATABASE_PORT | The port number of the MetaDB.  |
| DATABASE_USERNAME | The username of the MetaDB. In OceanBase Database, the username is in the format of `db_user@tenant_name#cluster_name`.  |
| DATABASE_PASSWORD | The password used to connect to the database.  |
| DATABASE_NAME | The name of the MetaDB.  |
| ODC_PROFILE_MODE | The profile mode. Default value: `alipay`.  |
| ODC_ADMIN_INITIAL_PASSWORD | The initial password of the administrator account of ODC. <main id="notice" type='notice'><h4>Notice</h4><p>The initial password must meet the following requirements:<ul><li>Contains at least two digits. </li><li>Contains at least two uppercase letters. </li><li>Contains at least two lowercase letters. </li><li>Contains at least two special characters, which can be . _ + @ # $ % </li><li>Contains 8 to 32 characters without spaces or other special characters. </li></ul></p></main> |

In addition to the preceding parameters, you can also use the following parameters when running the image.


| Parameter | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| ODC_LOG_DIR | The log directory. Default value: `/opt/odc/log`.  |
| ODC_JVM_HEAP_OPTIONS | The JVM heap size configurations. Default value: `-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=60.0 -XX:InitialRAMPercentage=60.0`, indicating that the JVM heap size is 60% of the total memory. You can also directly specify the JVM heap size by setting the `ODC_JVM_HEAP_OPTIONS` parameter. For example, `-Xmx2048m -Xms2048m` indicates that the heap size is 2 GB.  |
| ODC_JVM_GC_OPTIONS | The garbage collection strategy for JVM. Default value: `-XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+PrintAdaptiveSizePolicy -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps -XX:+PrintGCDateStamps -Xloggc:/opt/odc/log/gc.log -XX:+UseGCLogFileRotation -XX:GCLogFileSize=50M -XX:NumberOfGCLogFiles=5`.  |
| ODC_JVM_OOM_OPTIONS | The OutOfMemory strategy for JVM. Default value: `-XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError`.  |
| ODC_JVM_EXTRA_OPTIONS | Other JVM parameters. By default, no other parameter is specified.  |
| ODC_SERVER_PORT | The HTTP listening port for ODC-Server. Default value: `8989`.  |
| ODC_HOST | The IP address of ODC, which can be used as the destination IP address for remote procedure calls in high-availability deployment scenarios.  |
| ODC_MAPPING_PORT | The port number of ODC, which is specified to avoid port unavailability due to the deployment environment. This parameter is applicable to port mapping when ODC is deployed in Docker.  |
| ODC_APP_EXTRA_ARGS | Other app parameters. <br>For example, `--server.servlet.session.timeout=10m` indicates that the session timeout period is 10 minutes. By default, no other parameter is specified.  |

## Deploy an SSL certificate

When you log on to Web ODC in a browser over HTTP for the first time, you will receive a message indicating that the connection is not secure. To ensure access security, you can deploy an SSL certificate to access ODC over HTTPS. You can apply for a CA certificate or configure an HTTPS self-signed certificate. If you do not want to access ODC over HTTPS, you can skip this step and directly deploy Nginx.

### Apply for a CA certificate

To apply for a CA certificate, we recommend that you purchase an SSL certificate and an SSL certificate service on Alibaba Cloud. For more information, see [SSL certificate](https://www.aliyun.com/product/cas).

In the intranet environment, you can consult your IT administrator for the procedure of applying for a CA certificate.

### Configure an SSL self-signed certificate

The ODC image package contains an executable file that can generate a certificate and private keys: `generate-odc-ssl-certificate.sh`. You can run this file on the host to generate a certificate. A self-signed certificate can implement encrypted communication. However, the operating system does not trust a self-signed certificate by default. You can add the certificate to **Trusted Root Certificate Authorities** in the browser to configure certificate trust.

The following code shows how to run the executable file. The value for `domain` must be consistent with the domain name used by your ODC. Otherwise, the browser considers that the certificate does not match the site.

```shell
$./generate-odc-ssl-certificate.sh
Enter your domain [www.example.com]:
Enter your province [Zhejiang]:
Enter your city [Hangzhou]:
Enter your company name [OceanBase]:
Enter your company unit name [DBA]:
generate certificate...

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1708 Jun  3 15:18 server.key
```

The following code shows the content of the `generate-odc-ssl-certificate.sh` file. You can directly run the following command to generate a self-signed certificate.

```unknow
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# for generate self certificated ssl certificate files

echo try create directory '/etc/pki/nginx' if not exists...
sudo mkdir -p /etc/pki/nginx
cd /etc/pki/nginx || exit

    -subj "${SUBJ}"

echo "check generated files (use ls -l odcserver.
ls -l odcserver.
```

## Deploy the Nginx proxy

After you deploy the ODC image on all nodes, you need to deploy the Nginx proxy on one of the ODC nodes to route your requests to applications on different nodes. To deploy the Nginx proxy, you need to obtain and run the Nginx image on one node, copy the configuration file locally, and then modify the file. After the modification, stop running the Nginx image and then restart it to apply the modified configuration file.

### Load the image

Select a node and load and run the Nginx image. You can use the following methods to load the Nginx image:

* Pull the image from the Docker warehouse on the host.

* Download the image package to a local device, copy the package to the host, and decompress the package.

#### Pull the image from the Docker warehouse

Ensure that Docker is installed on the host and the host has access to the Internet. Then, run the following command in the command-line tool to pull the Nginx image from the Docker warehouse:

```javascript
docker pull nginx
```

#### Copy the image package to the host and decompress the package

1. Ensure that Docker is installed on the host and the host has access to the Internet. Then, run the following command on the host to download the image package to a local device:

   ```unknow
   docker save nginx:latest | gzip - >nginx.tar.gz
   ```

2. Copy the image package to the host and run the following command to load the image:

   ```javascript
   gunzip -c nginx.tar.gz | docker load
   ```

### Configure the configuration file

Before you start running the Nginx image, you must modify settings of the configuration file. The ODC image package contains templates of the configuration file. You can copy a template to a local device and edit the configuration where necessary. The templates of the configuration file vary, depending on whether you have deployed a self-signed certificate. We recommend that you copy a template based on the deployment and modify the configuration where necessary.

#### Configure the configuration file that does not contain the self-signed certificate

Run the following command to copy the configuration file from the image package to a custom path on the host for editing. The tilde (~) indicates the local path where the configuration file is located.

```javascript
docker cp -a <odc_image_name>:/opt/odc/conf/nginx.conf.template  ~/<conf_local_path>
```

The following code shows a template of the configuration file. We recommend that you modify the settings based on the comments.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
   <h4>Note</h4>
   <ul>
   <li>You can modify the load balancing configurations to ensure a sufficient proxy server timeout. The modification takes effect after you restart the Nginx proxy. </li>
   <li>We recommend that you set the <code>proxy_connect_timeout</code> parameter to a value not longer than 75 seconds. For more information, see <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_connect_timeout">proxy_connect_timeout</a>. </li>
   <li>If you do not set the <code>proxy_next_upstream</code> parameter to <code>off</code>, the Nginx proxy will forward your requests to the next ODC node.

   </ul>
</main>

### Start the image

After the configuration file is modified locally, run the following command in the command-line tool to restart the Nginx image. The tilde (~) indicates the local path where the configuration file is located.

```shell
docker run --network host --name nginx -v ～/<conf_local_path>:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf -v /etc/pki/nginx/:/etc/pki/nginx/ -d nginx
```

The following table describes the parameters in the command.

| Parameter | Description |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| --network host | Specifies to use a network port of the host. You do not need to configure port mapping in this case.    If you do not want to directly use the port of the host, you can specify the mapping ports using the `-p` parameter. For example, `-p 8080:80` specifies to map port 8080 of the host to port 80 of the Docker container. Likewise, `-p 8443:443` specifies to map port 8443 of the host to port 443 of the Docker container.  |
| --name nginx | Sets the name of the container to `nginx` for easier management. You can use other names, for example, `odc-nginx`.  |
| -v \~/\<conf_local_path\>:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf | Mounts the Docker container to the specified directory of the host and maps the local files of the host to the Docker container.  `<conf_local_path>` specifies a local path of the configuration file on the host, and then maps the configuration file to the `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` file in the Docker container.  |
| -v /etc/pki/nginx/:/etc/pki/nginx/ | Maps the `/etc/pki/nginx/` path of the host to the `/etc/pki/nginx/` path of the Docker container.  |
| -d nginx | Specifies to run the Docker container in the background.  |

## Configure certificate trust

A browser does not trust a self-signed certificate. You must manually configure certificate trust in the browser.

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
   <h4>Notice</h4>
