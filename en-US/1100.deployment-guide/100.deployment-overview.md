Deployment overview 
========================================

ODC is an enterprise-level database development platform tailored for OceanBase Database. ODC adopts the mature browser/server architecture and is accessible through either the Web or client version. 

This topic shows you how to deploy the web version of ODC. The client version does not need deployment and you can use it directly after installation. For more information about installing the client, see [Install ODC](../700.client-odc-user-guide/100.client-odc-install-odc.md). 

Single-node deployment 
-------------------------------------------

In single-node deployment, only one ODC node is deployed. This node handles all user requests. This deployment is simple and consumes fewer resources.

High-availability deployment 
-------------------------------------------------

In high-availability deployment, the ODC application is deployed on several server nodes. NGINX is installed on one of the servers as a reverse proxy to handle user requests. Therefore, in single-node deployment, user requests are sent directly to the ODC application, while in high-availability deployment, user requests are first sent to the server where NGINX is deployed, and are then directed to the ODC application on different servers. 

One benefit of high-availability deployment is service continuity. If one node is down, NGINX automatically forwards the traffic to other nodes. In addition, high-availability deployment supports more concurrent users and handles more requests than single-node deployment.

## Deployment process

### Single-node deployment process

To deploy ODC on a single node, load and run the ODC image on the node.

When you log on to Web ODC in a browser over HTTP for the first time, you will receive a message indicating that the connection is not secure. To ensure access security, you can configure an SSL certificate and deploy the Nginx image on the node by referring to the high-availability deployment process.

### High-availability deployment process

To deploy ODC in high-availability mode, load and run the ODC image on multiple nodes and then deploy the Nginx image on one of these nodes to distribute user requests among them.

To deploy Web ODC in high-availability mode, perform the following four steps:

1. [Load and run the ODC image](400.deploy-ha-odc-images.md): Run the ODC image separately on multiple nodes to install ODC.

2. Deploy the SSL certificate: When you log on to Web ODC in a browser over HTTP for the first time, you will receive a message indicating that the connection is not secure. To ensure access security, you can deploy an SSL certificate to access ODC over HTTPS. If you do not want to access ODC over HTTPS, you can skip this step and directly deploy the Nginx proxy.

3. Deploy the Nginx proxy: Pull and run the Nginx image on one of the nodes to implement high-availability deployment.

4. Configure certificate trust: Some browsers do not trust a self-signed certificate. You need to manually configure certificate trust in the browser.
