# Use the command-line window

## Background information

OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) integrates OceanBase Client (OBClient) in the form of a command-line window. OBClient is a command-line client recommended for OceanBase Database. You can directly execute SQL and PL statements and view the execution results in real time in a command-line window without the need to download or install OBClient. You can also run files uploaded to the server by using the `SOURCE` command.

## Considerations

- Client ODC that runs on macOS does not provide a command-line window.

- You can open at most three command-line windows.

- Operations performed in a command-line window are not recorded.

## Create a command-line window

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
   <h4>Notice</h4>
   <p>You can create up to three command-line windows at a time. If you create more than three command-line windows, the connection status of the windows cannot be guaranteed. </p>
</main>

Example: Execute a statement in a command-line window to insert data into the `employee` table in the `odc_test` database.

| Parameter | Example value |
| ------ | ------ |
| Data source | mysql410 |
| Database name | odc_test |
| Table name | employee |

1. In the SQL window, click the data source `mysql410`.

2. In a command line window, write an SQL statement to insert data into the `employee` table.

   ![2](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/422/500.sql-development/300.command-line-window/2EN.png)

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO `odc_test`.`employee`(`emp_no`,`birthday`,`name`) VALUES (1001,'2023-07-16','xiaohong');
   ```
3. Write an SQL statement to query the data inserted into the `employee` table.

   ```sql
   SELECT `emp_no`, `birthday`, `name` FROM `odc_test`.`employee`;
   ```
