# Generate test data

## Background information

OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) provides the data mocking feature for you to quickly generate data based on the field types of an existing table in scenarios that require a large amount of mock data, such as database performance testing and feature verification.

## Considerations

- At most 100 million rows can be mocked at a time.

- Data mocking is not supported for a table with `CHECK` constraints.

- Data mocking is not supported for a table that is encoded by using ZHSGB2312.

## Create a data mocking task

Example: On the **Ticket** tab, generate mock data based on an existing table in the database.

| Parameter | Example value |
| -------- | -------- |
| Project name | odc_4.2.0 |
| Database name | odc_test |
| Table name | employee |

1. In the SQL window, choose **Tickets** > **Mock Data** > **Create Mock Data Task**.

2. In the **Create Mock Data Task** panel, configure the following parameters.

   ![2](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/422/500.sql-development/600.data-mocking/2EN.png)

   | Parameter | Description |
   | -------- | -------- |
   | Database | Select the target database `odc_test`.  |
   | Table | Select the `employee` table in the `odc_test` database to generate mock data for this table.  |
   | Mock Data Volume | Specify the number of rows to be generated. The default value is `1000`. At most 100 million rows can be generated. You can enter a value ranging from 1 to 100,000,000.  |
   | Batch Size | Specify the number of rows for a batch commit by using the `COMMIT` command. By default, a batch commit is performed each time when 200 rows are generated. The maximum value is `500`. You can enter an integer ranging from 1 to 500.  |
   | Truncate Table Before Inserting Mock Data | Specify whether to clear the original data before inserting mock data into the table.  |
   | Data Conflict Handling Mode | Select the handling method when the inserted data conflicts with the original data in the table. Valid values:<ul><li>**Ignore**: This option is selected by default. The data conflicting with existing data is not inserted. </li><li>**Overwrite**: If a data conflict occurs, the original data is deleted, and the new data is inserted. </li><li>**Terminate**: If a data conflict occurs, the data mocking task is terminated. </li></ul> |
   | Rule Settings | Set the data generation rules. <br>In the **Rule** and **Rule Details** columns, set the mock data generation rules for the fields and field types in the selected table. Some built-in rules are provided in the **Rule** column based on the field types.  The **Rule Details** column displays the details about the selected rule. You can click the Edit icon to edit the details.  |
   | Task Settings | Select **Execute Now** or **Scheduled Execution**.  |

3. Click **Submit** to generate a data mocking task.

4. After a task is generated, the **Ticket** tab automatically appears, where you can view the approval status and basic information of the task.

## View a data mocking task

### Task information

1. In the data mocking task list on the **Ticket** tab, click **View** in the **Actions** column of the target task. In the **Task Details** panel of the target task, click the **Task Information** tab in the upper-right corner to view the basic task information and data mocking settings.

   ![3](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/422/500.sql-development/600.data-mocking/3EN.png)


   | Item | Description |
   |----------|------------------|
   | Basic task information | The ID, connection, database, type, execution mode, creator, and creation time of the task are displayed.  |
   | Data mocking settings | The target table, number of rows to generate, number of rows committed at a time, whether to truncate the table before inserting data, handling method for data conflicts, inserted records, conflict records, whether to ignore data conflicts, cleanup records, and rule settings are displayed.  |

2. In the **Task Information** panel, click **Initiate Again** or **Download** in the lower-right corner to initiate the task again or download the mock data file to your local disk.

### Task logs

In the data mocking task list on the **Ticket** tab, click **View** in the **Actions** column of the target task. In the **Task Details** panel of the task, click the **Task Logs** tab in the upper-right corner to view all logs and alert logs of the task.


| Parameter | Description |
|---------------|------------------|
| All Logs | Displays the complete information of all task logs, including **INFO**, **ERROR**, and **WARN** logs.  |
| Alert Logs | Displays the **ERROR** and **WARN** logs of the task.  When a task fails, you can view the error message in the alert logs.  |

In addition, the toolbar provides the following icons:

| Icon | Description |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Search | Click this icon to search for logs.  |
| Download | Click this icon to download logs.  |
| Copy | Click this icon to copy logs.  |


## Download mock data

In the data mocking task list on the **Ticket** tab, click **Download** in the **Actions** column of the target task to download the created mock data to your local disk. You can view the exported mock data file in your local disk.
