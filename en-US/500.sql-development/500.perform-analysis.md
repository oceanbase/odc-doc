# Analyze SQL statements

## Background information

The SQL window of OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) provides a GUI for data processing. In the SQL window, you can analyze an SQL statement to view its execution details and total execution duration.

This topic takes the `employee` table as an example to describe how to analyze an SQL statement.

## Execution plans

Assume that you need to query the `employee` table. Before you query the table, you can perform systematic evaluation on the query statement.

1. In the SQL window, edit the SQL statement for querying the data inserted into the `employee` table.

   ```sql
   SELECT `emp_no`, `birthday`, `name`, `time`, `test_col`, `status`, `age`, `state` FROM `employee`;
   ```
2. As shown in the preceding figure, select the SQL statement and click the **Plan** icon to view the estimated execution data (execution result of `EXPLAINPLAN`) for the selected SQL statement.

   The displayed execution data may be slightly different from the data generated after the statement is executed.

3. On the **Plan Details** tab, click **View Formatting Info** to switch to the formatted view.

## Execution details

- When you query, insert, update, delete, or retrieve database data in **OceanBase Database V4.2.4 or later**, you can click the <strong>Execution Profile</strong> icon on the **Result** tab to view the SQL execution details, execution plan, and end-to-end diagnostics in real time.

- During the execution of an SQL statement in **OceanBase Database of a version earlier than V4.2.4**, you can view the basic execution information, execution time statistics, I/O statistics, executed SQL statement, plan statistics, and outline in the <strong>Execution Details</strong> section.

## DB Time

On the **Execution Records** tab, you can hover the pointer over the icon next to a value in the **DB Execution Time** column. In the prompt box that appears, you can view the total execution duration of the SQL statement and verify whether the duration of each phase adds up to the total execution duration.
