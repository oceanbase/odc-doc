# Edit and export results

This topic introduces how to edit and export execution results.

## Background information

After editing and executing SQL statements in the SQL window of OceanBase Developer Center (ODC), you can view, edit, and export execution results on the **Results** tab.

## Edit result sets

Assume that you want to insert data into the `employee` table in the `odc_test` database on the **Results** tab.

| Parameter | Example |
| ------ | ------ |
| Project Name | odc_4.2.0 |
| Database Name | odc_test |
| Table Name | employee |

1. In the SQL window, edit and execute SQL statements to query data in the `employee` table.

   ```sql
   SELECT `emp_no`, `birthday`, `name` FROM `odc_test`.`employee`;
   ```
2. Edit the result set on the **Results** tab.

   The navigation bar on the **Results** tab also provides the following icons.

   | Icon | Description |
   |------|----------|
   | Edit | Click the **Edit** icon to enable editing mode for the current result set. The editing mode supports the following operations: **Add**, **Copy Current Row**, **Delete**, **Cancel**, **Confirm Modification**, which submits a transaction when auto commit is enabled, and **Modify and Submit**, which is displayed when auto commit is disabled. In the editing mode, you can either double-click target data to directly modify it or click the preceding icons for convenient operations.  In the editing mode, right-click a cell. The **Copy** and **Set to Null** buttons appear. <blockquote> **Note** <br>Whether the ResultMetaData obtained during the execution of an SQL statement can be edited indicates whether the result set of the SQL statement is editable. You can also determine whether the result set is editable based on the prompts on the Result tab when the result set is generated.<ul><li> If the result set cannot be edited, the **Edit** icon is grayed out and a prompt is displayed indicating that the result set cannot be edited.   </li><li> If the result set can be edited, the **Edit** icon is active and you can click it to go to the result set editing page. You can edit result sets in single-table and single-view queries.   </li><li> However, result sets that involve the SET and ENUM fields cannot be edited.  </li></ul></blockquote> |

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p>The current connection uses a shared session and the commit will apply to all windows. </p>
   </main>

5. In the **SQL Confirmation** dialog box, confirm the SQL statement and click **Execute**.


6. The data is added to the **Results** tab.


   The result set in the **Results** tab can be used in the following interactive operations to facilitate daily development work.

   | Action | Description |
   |--------------------------|-----------|
   | Select required data | You can select the required data of a result set and copy the data to an external file by using hotkeys. You can also click a field name or row ID to select an entire row or column.  You can also click **Export** in the toolbar to export data of a result set to a local file.  |
   | Select rows and columns | <ul><li> You can select consecutive rows or columns while holding the Shift key.</li><li> You can select inconsecutive rows or columns while holding the Ctrl or Command key. </li></ul> |
   | Right-click a cell | You can right-click a cell and select **Copy** or **Export to Clipboard** to directly export the data into an external file.  |
   | Right-click a row ID | You can select **Copy Row**, **Freeze this row**, **Unlock all frozen rows**, or **Export to Clipboard** .  <ul><li> Copy Row: Click this option to copy the selected row.</li>   <li> Freeze this row: Click this option to freeze the selected row and pin it to the top. You can freeze multiple rows. The rows under the table header and frozen rows can be vertically scrolled.</li>   <li> Unlock all frozen rows: Click this option to unfreeze all frozen rows.  </li><li> Export to Clipboard: Click this option to copy the entire row of data to the clipboard in SQL or CSV format. </li></ul> |
   | Zoom in | If the data in a cell is too long and cannot be displayed in full, you can use the zoom-in icon to view the data in full:<br> 1. Place the pointer over the cell.<br> 2. Click the ![Zoom-in](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/8892277361/p353161.jpg) icon on the right of the cell. In the window that appears, view the data in full. <blockquote> **Note**<br>LOBs are displayed in text by default. You can convert an LOB into the hexadecimal format and download the LOB to a local device. </blockquote> |
   | View BLOBs | On the **Results** tab:<ul><li> In Oracle mode, you can directly edit text data of the CLOB, BLOB, or RAW type, edit hexadecimal data, and upload files. The maximum allowed size is 2 MB for text data, 200 KB for hexadecimal data, and 20 MB for image files. </li>    <li>In MySQL mode, you can directly edit text data of the LOB types such as BLOB, MEDIUMBLOB, and TINYBLOB, edit hexadecimal data, and upload files. </li></ul> |
   | Right-click the tab name of the results tab | For example, you can right-click the tab name of the **Result 1** tab and click Pin in the context menu to pin the tab, so that it remains displayed.

Click **Unpin** to unpin a result tab.  |
   | Filter, sort, and search for data | Each field name in the result set is provided with a filter icon, a sort icon, and a search icon. You can use them to filter, sort, and search for data in a single column.  |
