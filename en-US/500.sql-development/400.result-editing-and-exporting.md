# Edit and export the result set of an SQL statement

## Background information

After you execute an SQL statement in the SQL window of the OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) console, you can view, edit, and export the execution result on the result tab.

## Edit the result set

Example: On the result tab, insert data into the `employee` table in the `odc_test` database.

| Parameter | Example value |
| ------ | ------ |
| Project name | odc_4.2.0 |
| Database name | odc_test |
| Table name | employee |

1. In the SQL window, write and execute an SQL statement to query data in the `employee` table.

   ```sql
   SELECT `emp_no`, `birthday`, `name` FROM `employee`;
   ```
2. On the result tab shown in the preceding figure, click the **Edit** icon to edit the result set.

   | Edit | Click **Edit** to enable editing mode for the current result set. The editing mode supports the following operations: **Add**, **Copy Current Row**, **Delete**, **Cancel**, **Confirm Modification**, which submits a transaction when autocommit is enabled, and **Modify and Submit**, which is displayed when autocommit is disabled. In editing mode, you can either double-click the target data to directly modify it or click the preceding icons for convenient operations.  When you edit a cell, you can right-click the cell and choose **Copy** or **Set to Null** from the context menu. <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4>The ResultMetaData is obtained during the execution of an SQL statement to indicate whether the result set can be edited.<ul><li> If the result set cannot be edited, the **Edit** icon is hidden and a prompt is displayed indicating that the result set cannot be edited.   </li><li> If the result set can be edited, the **Edit** icon is available and you can click it to go to the result set editing page.
