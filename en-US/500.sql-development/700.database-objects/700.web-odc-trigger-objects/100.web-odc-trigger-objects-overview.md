Overview
=============================

Triggers are special stored procedures that are triggered by events but cannot be explicitly called. Therefore, triggers are used to monitor specific situations and trigger corresponding actions.

Log on to OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) and click the name of the target connection in Oracle mode to go to the corresponding connection management page. You can click Trigger in the left-side navigation pane to get a list of triggers. Click **+** in the upper-right corner of the list to go to the Create Trigger page. You can also double-click the name of a trigger in the list to go to the trigger management page. On this page, you can view the basic information and codes of the trigger.
**Notice**



After you connect ODC to OceanBase Database V2.2.20 or a later version in Oracle mode, you can create trigger objects in ODC. The MySQL mode does not support this feature.

This chapter describes in different topics the operations you can perform on trigger objects in ODC.
