# Manage tables

This topic aims to introduce information about table lists, table properties, and table data.

## Table list

Log on to OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) and click the name of the target connection to go to the corresponding connection management page. You can click **Table** in the left-side navigation pane to get a list of tables. The table list displays the table objects in the connected database. In the table list, you can view the structure tree of an object. You can also right-click the target object to perform some management actions on the object.

## Structure tree

You can click the expand icon before the name of the target table in the table list, and the structure tree of the table is displayed in a drop-down list, as shown in the above figure. The structure tree of a table can have up to three levels. When you right-click an item in the tree, the shortcut menu displays some actions that you can perform on the item. 

## Management actions

Right-click the target object in the structure tree. A shortcut menu appears, displaying some management options provided by ODC for you to conveniently manage the target object. 
The following table describes the management options.

| Option |Description  |

Click **Index** in the left-side navigation pane of the **Attribute** tab to view the indexes in the current table.

On the **Index** tab, you can rename an index and make an index visible or invisible.

In ODC V4.2.2 and later, you can view whether an index is available. An index marked with the alert icon <img src="https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/icon/index.png" width="20"> is unavailable.

| Field | Description |
|--------|----------------------------|
| Index Name | The name of the index. |
| Scope | The default value is GLOBAL. Valid values: GLOBAL and LOCAL.  |
|Method|The default value is BTREE, which is applicable to a global index. Valid values: Empty, BTREE, and HASH.<ul><li>A BTREE index stores data in a B+ tree structure, and is suitable for searching for SQL statements in the specified index scope.</li><li>A HASH index is implemented based on a HASH table, and is used only when the query conditions exactly match all columns in the HASH index. A HASH index can be used only for query conditions that use the equal operator (=), IN operator, or NULL-safe equal operator (<=>). A HASH index cannot be used for sorting and is not suitable for columns with less distinctive values, such as the gender column.</li></ul>|
|Index Type|The default value isNORMAL. Valid values: NORMAL, UNIQUE, and FULLTEXT.<ul><li>NORMALindicates a normal index.</li><li>UNIQUE indicates a unique index that does not allow duplicate values, such as the emp_no column.</li><li>FULLTEXT indicates a full-text index, which is used to search a table that contains a large amount of data.</li></ul>|
|Columns|The columns to be indexed. Pay attention to the order of the indexed columns.|
|Invisible|Specify whether the index is invisible.|

### Constraint information

![5](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/340/%E8%A1%A8%E5%B1%9E%E6%80%A7%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86-5-EN.png)

OceanBase Cloud supports different constraints in MySQL and Oracle modes, and different constraints require different information. Therefore, you need to specify the required information based on the constraint you selected and the requirements on the page.

| Field | Description |
|-----|-----------------|
|Constraint Name|The name of the constraint.|
|Column Information|The field or a group of fields specified as the constraint.|
|Associated Schema|The schema where the associated table is located when Foreign Key Constraint is used. The associated table is the parent table. This field is valid only in Oracle mode.|
|Associated Database|The database where the associated table is located when Foreign Key Constraint is used. The associated table is the parent table. This field is valid only in MySQL mode.|
|Associated Table|The associated table when Foreign Key Constraint is used. The associated table is the parent table.|
|Associated Field|The associated field when Foreign Key Constraint is used. The associated field is in the parent table.|
|Delete|Specifies the action to be performed on the current table when the data in the associated table is deleted. The current table is the child table, and the associated table is the parent table.<br>The following four types of action are supported: CASCADE, NO ACTION, RESTRICT, and SET NULL. OceanBase Cloud supports different foreign key actions in MySQL and Oracle modes.<ul><li>In MySQL mode, OceanBase Cloud allows you to specify CASCADE, NO ACTION, RESTRICT, and SET NULL.</li><li>In Oracle mode, OceanBase Cloud allows you to specify CASCADE, NO ACTION, and SET NULL.</li></ul>|
|Update|Specifies the action to be performed on the current table when the data in the associated table is updated. The current table is the child table, and the associated table is the parent table.<br>The following four types of action are supported: CASCADE, NO ACTION, RESTRICT, and SET NULL.<br>OceanBase Cloud supports different foreign key actions in MySQL and Oracle modes.<ul><li>In MySQL mode, OceanBase Cloud allows you to specifyCASCADE,NO ACTION, RESTRICT, and SET NULL.</li><li>In Oracle mode, OceanBase Cloud allows you to specify NO ACTION.</li></ul>|
|Check Condition|Specifies the check rules for data verification when Check Constraint is enabled.|

### Partition information

![6](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/340/%E8%A1%A8%E5%B1%9E%E6%80%A7%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86-6-EN.png)

The definition of a partition in MySQL mode is different from that in Oracle mode. So, the values of the following fields vary in different modes. You need to specify the following fields based on the selected partitioning method.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-----------|
| Partitioning Method | Specifies the partitioning method. The partitioning methods supported in MySQL mode are different from those in Oracle mode.<ul><li>Range partitioning: Multiple rows with column values in an ordered, continuous, and non-overlapping range are assigned to a partition.</li><li>List partitioning: A table is partitioned based on the enumeration values.</li><li>Hash partitioning: A table is partitioned based on a given number of partitions. For a table that stores data without a clear pattern or range, you can use hash partitioning to randomly distribute values of the partition column to different partitions based on the HASH algorithm.</li><li>Key partitioning: This partitioning method is similar to HASH partitioning. The difference is that key partitioning only supports computation of one or more columns, and the MySQL server provides its own hash function. At least one INT type column is required for Key partitioning.</li></ul> |
|Field |The column that is used as the partition key.  |
| Expression | Partitions are divided based on the return value of the expression. The partition expression is not supported in Oracle mode. |
|Partition  |  Based on the value specified for Partitioning Method, you may need to specify information such asPartition Name, Partition Quantity, Upper Limit, and Value Enumeration. You can add multiple partitions and drag selected fields to adjust their order. |

### DDL information

Click **DDL** in the left-side navigation pane of the **attribute** tab to view the DDL statement of the current table, namely, the SQL statement that defines the table. This statement cannot be edited. The following table describes the icons provided in the toolbar.

## Table data management
