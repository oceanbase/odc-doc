# Create a table


## Overview


OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) allows you to create a table on a GUI. This topic describes how to create a table in the ODC console.

![1](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/422/500.sql-development/700.database-objects/100.web-odc-table-objects/200.web-odc-create-a-table/1EN.png)

The procedure comprises seven steps:

1. Specify the basic information.

2. Set columns.

3. Set indexes.

4. Set constraints.

5. Set partitioning rules.

6. Verify the SQL statement.

7. Complete the table creation.

## Procedure

In the following example, a table named `employee` is created in the ODC console. The table contains the `emp_no`, `birthdate`, `name`, and `gender` columns. Perform the following steps:

### Step 1: Specify the basic information

Log on to the ODC console and click the name of the desired connection to go to the corresponding connection management page. You can click **Table** in the left-side navigation pane to view tables. To create a table, click the plus sign (**+**) in the upper-right corner of the table list or click **Create** in the top navigation bar.

In the **Basic Info** section, set the **Table Name** and **Description** parameters.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
   <h4>Note</h4>
   <ul>
   <li>In MySQL mode, you also need to set the <b>Default Character Set</b> and <b>Default Collation</b> parameters. </li>
   <li>After you specify the basic information and go to the "Set columns" step, the basic information is submitted. </li>
   </ul>
</main>

### Step 2: Set columns

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
   <h4>Note</h4>
   <p>In ODC V4.2.3 and later, you can create a table that contains columns of spatial data types in <a href="https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-cn-1000000000221534">OceanBase Database in MySQL mode</a> or <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/spatial-type-overview.html">MySQL Database</a>. </p>
</main>

The following figure and table show the information that you need to specify when you add a column.

![Step 2](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/340/%E6%96%B0%E5%BB%BA%E8%A1%A8-%E6%AD%A5%E9%AA%A42-EN.png)

| Parameter | Description |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name | The name of the column.  |
| Type | The data type of the column. <br>For more information about data types, see [OceanBase Database Developer Guide](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-cn-1000000000036273).  |
| Length | The length of the data type.  |
| Scale | The number of decimal places of the data type.  |
| Non-empty | Specifies whether the value of the column is required.  |
| Auto-increment | Specifies whether the column is an auto-increment column. This parameter is valid in MySQL mode. <main id="notice" type='notice'><h4>Notice</h4><ul><li>Only one auto-increment column is allowed for a table. </li><li>You can select **Auto-increment** only for one column at a time. </li></ul></main> |
| Virtual Column | Specifies whether to set the column as a virtual column. <main id="notice" type='notice'><h4>Notice</h4><ul><li>If you select <strong>Virtual Column</strong>, you must specify an expression for the virtual column. </li><li>When you create a virtual column, you must define an expression that the virtual column depends on. A virtual column is a generated column, which can be a virtual generated column or a stored generated column. The value of a virtual column is calculated based on the expression only when the column is used. Therefore, when you insert data into the table, you cannot specify values for the virtual column. </li></ul></main> |
| Default Value/Expression | The default value or expression of the column.  |
| Comment | The additional information about the column.  |

The following table describes operations that you can perform on the column setting page.

| Operation | Description |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Toolbar operations | You can add or delete columns by using the top toolbar of the page.  |
| Click a row ID | <ul><li> You can click a row ID to select the row and display a context menu that allows you to add or delete the row.  </li><li> You can click a row number to select the row and then drag the row to adjust the order of the entire row. </li></ul> |
| Right-click a row | You can right-click a row to select it, and then select Copy or Move Down from the context menu that appears.  |

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
   <h4>Note</h4>
   <ul>
   <li>After you copy a row, you can paste the row by using the <b>Command + V</b> or <b>Ctrl + V</b> shortcut keys. </li>
   <li>The auxiliary editing section at the bottom of the page displays additional information about the selected column. </li>
   <li>The basic information and column settings are required. The settings in other configuration steps are optional. After you specify the basic information and column settings, you can submit the settings and confirm the SQL statement to create the table. </li>
   </ul>
</main>

### Step 3: Set indexes

If a table contains a large amount of data, you can use indexes to accelerate data queries. An index is a data structure that pre-sorts the values of one or more columns in a table. By using indexes, you can directly locate records that meet the conditions.

The following figure and table show the information that you need to specify when you set an index.

![Step 3](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/340/%E6%96%B0%E5%BB%BA%E8%A1%A8-%E6%AD%A5%E9%AA%A43-EN.png)

| Parameter | Description |
|------|---------------|
| Index Name | The name of the index.  |
| Range | The default value is **GLOBAL**. Valid values: **GLOBAL** and **LOCAL**.  |
| Method | The default value is **BTREE**, which is applicable to a global index. Valid values: **Empty**, **BTREE**, and **HASH**. <ul><li> A BTREE index stores data in a B+ tree structure, and is applicable to searching for SQL statements in the specified index scope.  </li><li> A HASH index is implemented based on a HASH table, and is used only when the query conditions exactly match all columns in the HASH index. A HASH index can be used only for query conditions that use the equal operator (=), IN operator, or NULL-safe equal operator (<=>). A HASH index cannot be used for sorting and is not suitable for columns with less distinctive values, such as the gender column. </li></ul> |
| Index Type | The default value is **NORMAL**. Valid values: **NORMAL**, **UNIQUE**, and **FULLTEXT**. <ul><li> **NORMAL** indicates a normal index. </li><li> **UNIQUE** indicates an index that does not allow duplicate values, such as the `emp_no` column.  </li><li> **FULLTEXT** indicates a full-text index, which is used to search a table that contains a large amount of data. </li></ul> |
| Columns | The columns to be indexed. Pay attention to the order of the indexed columns.  |
| Invisible | Specifies whether the index is invisible.  |

The index setting page provides the following icons.

| Icon | Description |
|-----|------------|
| Create | Click this icon to create an index.  |
| Delete | Click this icon to delete the selected index.  |

### Step 4: Set constraints

Constraints are used to specify data rules for a table. A data operation that violates the constraints is terminated.

![Step 4](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/340/%E6%96%B0%E5%BB%BA%E8%A1%A8-%E6%AD%A5%E9%AA%A44-EN.png)

ODC supports the following four types of table constraints:

* **PRIMARY KEY constraint**: defines a primary key to uniquely identify each row of data in the table. A PRIMARY KEY constraint can be a field or a group of fields. You can set only one PRIMARY KEY constraint for a table, and you cannot modify the PRIMARY KEY constraint after you configure the constraint.

* **UNIQUE constraint**: ensures that the data in a field or a group of fields is unique in the table. You can set multiple UNIQUE constraints in one table.

* **FOREIGN KEY constraint**: associates one or more columns in two tables. A FOREIGN KEY constraint is used to maintain the data consistency and integrity between associated tables. After you complete the setting of FOREIGN KEY constraints, you cannot create new constraints or modify existing constraints.

* **CHECK constraints**: checks the data in the database based on the configured check rules when you edit the data. Data modification is allowed only after the check is passed.

OceanBase Database supports different constraints in MySQL and Oracle modes, and different constraints require different information. Therefore, you need to specify the required information based on the constraint you selected and the requirements on the page.

| Parameter | Description |
|----------|----------------|
| Constraint Name | The name of the constraint.  |
| Column Information | The field or a group of fields specified as the constraint.  |
| Associated Schema | The schema where the associated table is located when **Foreign Key Constraint** is used. The associated table is the parent table. This field is valid only in Oracle mode.  |
| Associated Database | The database where the associated table is located when **Foreign Key Constraint** is used. The associated table is the parent table. This field is valid only in MySQL mode.  |
| Associated Table | The associated table when **Foreign Key Constraint** is used. The associated table is the parent table.  |
| Associated Field | The associated field when **Foreign Key Constraint** is used. The associated field is in the parent table.  |
| Delete | Specifies the action to be performed on the current table when the data in the associated table is deleted. The current table is the child table, and the associated table is the parent table. <br>The following four types of action are supported: **CASCADE**, **NO ACTION**, **RESTRICT**, and **SET NULL**. <br>The actions supported in MySQL mode are different from those in Oracle mode.<ul><li> In MySQL mode, you can specify **CASCADE**, **NO ACTION**, **RESTRICT**, and **SET NULL**. </li><li> In Oracle mode, you can specify **CASCADE**, **NO ACTION**, and **SET NULL**. <main id="notice" type='notice'><h4>Notice</h4><p>At present, OceanBase Database does not support <strong>SET NULL</strong>. <br>For more information about the syntax, see  <a href="https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-10000000000872376">CREATE TABLE</a> or the official documentation of MySQL or Oracle. </p></main> |
| Update | Specifies the action to be performed on the current table when the data in the associated table is updated. The current table is the child table, and the associated table is the parent table. <br>The following four types of action are supported: **CASCADE**, **NO ACTION**, **RESTRICT**, and **SET NULL**. <br>The actions supported in MySQL mode are different from those in Oracle mode.<ul><li> In MySQL mode, you can specify **CASCADE**, **NO ACTION**, **RESTRICT**, and **SET NULL**. </li><li> In Oracle mode, you can specify **NO ACTION**. </li></ul> <main id="notice" type='notice'><h4>Notice</h4><p>At present, OceanBase Database does not support <strong>SET NULL</strong>. <br>For more information about the syntax, see  <a href="https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-10000000000872376">CREATE TABLE</a> or the official documentation of MySQL or Oracle. </p></main> |
| Check Condition | Specifies the check rules for data verification when **Check Constraint** is enabled.  |

The constraint setting page provides the following icons.


| Icon | Description |
|-----|------------|
| Create | Click this icon to create a constraint.  |
| Delete | Click this icon to delete the selected constraint.  |

### Step 5: Set partitioning rules

![Step 5](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/340/%E6%96%B0%E5%BB%BA%E8%A1%A8-%E6%AD%A5%E9%AA%A45-EN.png)

You can partition a table that contains a large amount of data. After a table is partitioned, data in the table is stored in multiple tablespaces. The database does not scan the entire table for a query.

* In MySQL mode, OceanBase Database supports the following partitioning methods: **KEY**, **HASH**, **RANGE**, **RANGE COLUMNS**, **LIST**, and **LIST COLUMNS**.

* In Oracle mode, OceanBase Database supports the following three partitioning methods: **List**, **Range**, and **Hash**.

   The definition of a partition in MySQL mode is different from that in Oracle mode. So, the values of the following fields vary in different modes. You need to specify the following fields based on the selected partitioning method.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |------|----------|
   | Partitioning Method | Specifies the partitioning method.  The partitioning methods supported in MySQL mode are different from those in Oracle mode. <ul><li> RANGE partitioning: Multiple rows with column values in an ordered, continuous, and non-overlapping range are assigned to a partition. </li><li> LIST partitioning: A table is partitioned based on the enumeration values.  </li><li> HASH partitioning: A table is partitioned based on a given number of partitions. For a table that stores data without a clear pattern or range, you can use hash partitioning to randomly distribute values of the partition column to different partitions based on the HASH algorithm. </li><li> KEY partitioning: This partitioning method is similar to HASH partitioning. The difference is that KEY partitioning supports computation of only one or more columns, and the MySQL server provides its own hash function. At least one INT type column is required for Key partitioning.  </li></ul>  |
   | Field | The column that is used as the partitioning key.  |
   | Expression | Partitions are divided based on the return value of the expression. The partition expression is not supported in Oracle mode.  |
   | Partition | Based on the value specified for **Partitioning Method**, you may need to specify information such as **Partition Name**, **Partition Quantity**, **Upper Limit**, and **Value Enumeration**.  You can add multiple partitions and drag selected fields to adjust their order.  |

### Step 6: Confirm the SQL statement

![Create a table - Step 6](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/410/table/create%20table-EN.png)

After you click **Execute**, you can view the statement on the SQL confirmation page. You can check and format the statement.

The syntax is as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (column_name column_type, column_name column_type,.......);
```

The following table describes the fields in the syntax.

| Field | Description |
|--------------|--------------|
| CREATE TABLE | The keyword that indicates the creation of a table with a specified name. You must have the permission to create tables.  |
| table_name | The name of the table. The table name must conform to the identifier naming rules.  |
| column_name column_type | The name and data type of each column in the table. Separate the tuples of multiple columns with commas (,).  |

### Step 7: Complete the table creation

Click **Execute**. After the table is created, the employee table appears in the table list in the left-side navigation pane.

![8](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/422/500.sql-development/700.database-objects/100.web-odc-table-objects/200.web-odc-create-a-table/8EN.png)

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
   <h4>Note</h4>
   <p>You can click the More icon next to a table name in the table list in the left-side navigation pane, and select <strong>View Table Schema</strong>, <strong>View Table Data</strong>, <strong>Import</strong>, <strong>Export</strong>, <strong>Download</strong>, <strong>Mock Data</strong>, <strong>Open SQL Window</strong>, <strong>Copy</strong>, <strong>Delete</strong>, or <strong>Refresh</strong> from the context menu to manage or operate the table. For more information, see <a href="../100.web-odc-table-objects/500.web-odc-manage-table-data.md">Manage table data</a>.</p>
</main>

You can use the `SELECT` statement to query data in the new table.

The syntax is as follows:

```sql
SELECT
 column_name,
 column_name
FROM
 table_name [WHERE Clause] [LIMIT N] [ OFFSET M]
```

The following table describes the fields in the syntax.

| Field | Description |
|-------------|------------|
| SELECT | The keyword that indicates the name of the statement. You can use the SELECT statement to read one or more records.  |
| column_name | The name of the column to be queried.  You can use an asterisk (*) in the format of \* to query all columns  |
| WHERE | The keyword of the condition clause.  |
| LIMIT | The number of records to be returned.  |
| OFFSET | The data offset from which the SELECT statement starts to query.  The default offset is 0.  |

Here is an example:

```sql
SELECT `emp_no`, `birthdate`, `name`, `gender` FROM `employee`;
```
