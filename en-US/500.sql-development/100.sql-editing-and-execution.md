# Write and execute SQL statements

This topic describes how to write and execute an SQL statement in the SQL window.

## Background information

The SQL window of OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) provides a GUI for data processing. You can sort, filter, add, edit, and delete data, and execute database objects in the SQL window.

## Write SQL statements

Example: In the SQL window, create a table named `employee` in the `odc_test` database in the `odc_4.2.0` project.

| Parameter | Example value |
| ------ | ------ |
| Project name | odc_4.2.0 |
| Data source | mysql410 |
| Database name | odc_test |
| Table name | employee |

1. In the **odc_4.2.0** project, click **Log on to Database** to go to the SQL window.

   ![1](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/422/400.connection-management/300.database-operation-and-maintenance/100.session-management/1EN.png)

2. In the SQL window, write an SQL statement to create a table named `employee`.

   ![4](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/423/500.sql-development/sql4EN.png)

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE odc_test.employee (emp_no int(120) COMMENT 'Employee ID' NOT NULL, birthday date COMMENT 'Birthday' NULL,name varchar(120) COMMENT 'Name' NULL,CONSTRAINT cons_employee_empno PRIMARY KEY (emp_no)) DEFAULT CHARSET = utf8mb4    COLLATE = utf8mb4_general_ci;
   ```

   The syntax is as follows:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE table_name (column_name column_type, column_name column_type,.......);
   ```

   The following table describes the fields in the syntax.

   | Field | Description |
   |-------------------------|----------------------------------------|
   | CREATE TABLE | The keyword that indicates the creation of a table with a specified name. You must have the permission to create tables.  |
   | table_name | The name of the table. The table name must conform to the identifier naming rules.  |
   | column_name column_type | The name and data type of each column in the table. Separate the tuples of multiple columns with commas (,).  |

   The following table describes the icons provided in the toolbar of the SQL window.

   | Icon | Description |
   |--------|------------------|
   | SQL Check | Click this icon to check the syntax of the SQL statement.  |
   | Plan | Click this icon to view the estimated execution plan (execution result of `EXPLAIN`) for the SQL statement that is selected or on which the pointer hovers. The displayed execution data may be slightly different from the data generated after statement execution. You can use this feature to evaluate an SQL statement. <br>Click the **Plan** icon. On the **Plan Details** tab, click **View Formatting Info** to switch to the formatted view.  |
   | Find and Replace | Click this icon and enter text in the search field to find the specific content and enter text in the replacement field to replace the content found.  |
   | Undo | Click this icon to undo the previous operation.  |
   | Redo | Click this icon to reverse an **Undo** operation.  |
   | Format | Click this icon to apply formatting, such as indentation, line break, and keyword highlighting, to the selected SQL statements or all the SQL statements in the current SQL window.  |
   | IN Value Conversion | Click this icon to convert the copied rows or columns into the specified format during queries. <br>After you paste the copied data to the SQL editing area, select the copied data and click **IN Value Conversion** to convert it into the `in('A','B')` format. <ul><li> Column values are separated with line breaks. </li><li> Row values are separated with spaces or tabs. </li></ul> |
   | Case Sensitivity | The system supports three capitalization formats: **All Caps**, **All Lowercase**, and **Capitalize First Letter**. Click this icon to convert the selected statements in the script to the corresponding capitalization format.  |
   | Indent | You can add indents to or delete indents from the statements that you selected.  |
   | Comment | You can click **Add Comment** to convert the statements that you select into comments or click **Delete Comment** to convert comments to SQL statements.  |
   | Settings | <ul><li> **Delimiter**: Select the sign that you want to use as the delimiter from the drop-down list. Five types of delimiters are supported: semi-colons (**;**), slashes (**/**), double slashes (**//**), dollar signs (**$**), and double dollar signs (**$$**).  </li><li> **Query Result Limit**: Set the maximum number of lines that a query can return. Default value: `1000`.  </li><li> **Obtain Column Information of Result Set**: Choose whether to obtain information about columns in the result set before SQL execution. If the table contains a large number of columns, we recommend that you disable this option. After you disable this option, column comments and editable columns are not queried, which shortens the SQL execution time. </li><li> **Session Variable**: You can edit, refresh, and search for variables. </li></ul> |

   In the SQL window shown in the preceding figure, click ![select a database](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/423/500.sql-development/select%20a%20databaseEN.png) to switch to another database.

## Execute SQL statements

1. After you complete writing SQL statements, click **Press F8** in the toolbar to run all SQL statements in the current SQL window. The following table describes the icons related to SQL statement execution.

   | Icon | Description |
   |--------|------------------|
   | Press F8 | Click this icon to run all SQL statements in the current SQL window. You can also press **F8** to run all SQL statements in the current SQL window.  |
   | Run Current Statement (F9) | Click this icon to run all selected SQL statements or the statement in the line where the pointer hovers. You can also press **F9**, or press **Ctrl + Enter** in Windows or **Command + Enter** in macOS to run the current statement.  |
   | Abort | Click this icon to abort the statements being executed.  |
