# SQL editing and execution

This topic describes how to edit and execute an SQL statement in the SQL window.

## Background information

The SQL window of OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) provides a GUI for data processing. You can sort, filter, add, edit, and delete data, and execute database objects in the SQL window.

The example in this topic describes how to create a table named `employee` in the `odc_test` database in the SQL window.

   <p>The data used in this topic are examples. You can replace them with actual data as needed. </p>
</main>

## Edit SQL statements

1. In the **odc_4.2.0** project, click **Log on to Database** to go to the SQL window.

2. In the SQL window, edit an SQL statement to create a table named `employee`.

   ![2](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/430/500.sql-development/100.sql-editing-and-execution/2EN.png)

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE odc_test.employee (emp_no int(120) COMMENT 'Employee ID' NOT NULL, birthday date COMMENT 'Birthday' NULL,name varchar(120) COMMENT 'Name' NULL,CONSTRAINT cons_employee_empno PRIMARY KEY (emp_no)) DEFAULT CHARSET = utf8mb4    COLLATE = utf8mb4_general_ci;
   ```

   The syntax is as follows:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE table_name (column_name column_type, column_name column_type,.......);
   ```

   The following table describes the fields in the syntax.

   | Field | Description |
   |-------------------------|----------------------------------------|
   | CREATE TABLE | The keyword that indicates the creation of a table with a specified name. You must have the permission to create tables.  |
   | table_name | The name of the table. The table name must conform to the identifier naming rules.  |
   | column_name column_type | The name and data type of each column in the table. Separate the tuples of multiple columns with commas (,).  |

   - In the SQL window shown in the preceding figure, click <img src="https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/430/500.sql-development/100.sql-editing-and-execution/select%20a%20databaseEN.png" width="40"> to switch to another database.

   - For more information about the toolbar of the SQL window, see [Common features](../1350.feature-details.md).

## Execute SQL statements

1. After you complete writing SQL statements, click **Press F8** in the toolbar to run all SQL statements in the current SQL window. The following table describes the icons related to SQL statement execution.

   | Icon | Description |
   |--------|------------------|
   | Press F8 | Click this icon to run all SQL statements in the current SQL window. You can also press **F8** to run all SQL statements in the current SQL window.  |
   | Run Current Statement (F9) | Click this icon to run all selected SQL statements or the statement in the line where the pointer is hovering. You can also press **F9**, or press **Ctrl+Enter** in Windows or **Command+Enter** in macOS to run the current statement.  |
   | Abort | Click this icon to abort the running statements.  |
