Upgrade process 
====================================



The upgrade of OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) in single-node deployment mode requires three steps.

1. [Stop ODC of the earlier version](../3.upgrade-single-node-odc/2.stop-the-old-odc-version.md): Stop the ODC container of the earlier version in Docker.

   

2. [Load and run the ODC image](../3.upgrade-single-node-odc/3.upgrade-guide-load-and-run-single-odc-images.md): Load and run the image of the new version on the server to upgrade ODC.

   

3. [Upgrade the NGINX image](../4.upgrade-high-availability-odc/4.upgrade-nginx-image.md): You can upgrade the NGINX image on a single ODC node if an SSL certificate is configured and the NGINX image is deployed on the node. For more information about the upgrade procedure, see the ODC upgrade procedure in the high-availability deployment mode.
