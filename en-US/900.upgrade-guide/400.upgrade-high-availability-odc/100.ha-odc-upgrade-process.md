Upgrade process 
====================================
#docslug#/oceanbase-developer-center/odc/V3.2.2/upgrade-process


The upgrade of OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) in high-availability deployment mode requires three steps:

1. [Stop ODC of the earlier version](../4.upgrade-high-availability-odc/2.ha-odc-stop-the-old-odc-version.md): Stop the ODC container of the earlier version in Docker.

   

2. [Load and run the ODC image](../4.upgrade-high-availability-odc/3.upgrade-load-and-run-ha-odc-images.md): Load and run the new ODC image on each node in high-availability deployment mode to upgrade ODC.

   

3. [Upgrade the NGINX image](../4.upgrade-high-availability-odc/4.upgrade-nginx-image.md): You can choose whether to upgrade the NGINX image to the latest version. To upgrade the NGINX image, you must stop and delete the old image, obtain the image of the latest version on the host, and deploy the NGINX proxy.
