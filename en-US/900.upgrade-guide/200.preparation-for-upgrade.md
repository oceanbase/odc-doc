Preparation for upgrade 
============================================
#docslug#/oceanbase-developer-center/odc/V3.2.2/preparation-for-upgrade
Before you deploy OceanBase Developer Center (ODC), you must prepare the MetaDB and the server. 

MetaDB 
---------------------------

The MetaDB was created when deploying Web ODC to store user data that is generated during operation. When you upgrade ODC, you must reinitialize the MetaDB and run the ODC image of the corresponding version. Before the upgrade, check the name of the MetaDB tenant, name of cluster where the tenant resides, database name, username, and password.

Server 
---------------------------

The server that runs Web ODC has at least 2 CPU cores and 4 GB of memory. The recommended server specification is 4 CPUs and 8 GB of memory. Therefore, you need to check the server when upgrading ODC. 

To upgrade ODC, you need to re-obtain and run the ODC image on the server. Make sure that Docker is installed and can run normally on the server before the upgrade.
