Upgrade NGINX image 
========================================

When you upgrade Web ODC, you can choose whether to upgrade the NGINX image to the latest version. To upgrade the NGINX image, you must stop and delete the old image, obtain the image of the latest version on the host, and deploy the NGINX proxy. 

Stop and delete the old image 
--------------------------------------------------

Before you deploy the NGINX image of the latest version, you must stop and delete the NGINX image that is running on the host. 

Procedure:

1. Run the `docker ps -a` command in the command-line tool of the host to view the running containers. You can find the container ID of the earlier NGINX image in the `CONTAINER ID` column based on the image name in the `IMAGE` column. Execution result:

   ```javascript
   "  C:\Users\ob>docker ps -a
   CONTAINER ID        IMAGE            COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                      NAMES
   8bfecbc1cd03        bdd6f8916e8b    "/bin/sh -c '/usr/bi... 13 days ago            Up 13 days          80/tcp, 8080/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8989->8989/tcp   nginx
   ```

   

2. After you obtain the container ID, run the `docker stop <CONTAINER ID>;` command in the command-line tool to stop the ODC container of the earlier version. Execution result:

   ```javascript
   C:\Users\ob>docker stop 8bfecbc1cd03
   8bfecbc1cd03
   ```

   

3. Run the `docker rm <CONTAINER ID>;` command in the command-line tool to delete the ODC image of the earlier version and release the port occupied. Execution result:

   ```javascript
   C:\Users\ob>docker rm 8bfecbc1cd03
   8bfecbc1cd03
   ```

   




Load the new image 
---------------------------------------

You can use the following methods to load the NGINX image of the latest version:

* Pull the image from the Docker warehouse on the host.

  

* Download the image package to a local device, copy the package to the host, and decompress the package.

  




### Pull the image from the Docker warehouse 

Ensure that Docker is installed on the host and the host has access to the Internet. Then, run the following command in the command-line tool to pull the NGINX image from the Docker warehouse:

```javascript
docker pull nginx
```



### Copy the image package to the host and decompress the package 

Ensure that Docker is installed on the host and the host has access to the Internet. Then, run the following command on the host to download the image package to a local device:

```unknow
docker save nginx:latest | gzip - >nginx.tar.gz
```



Copy the image package to the host and run the following command to load the image:

```javascript
gunzip -c nginx.tar.gz | docker load
```



Configure the configuration file 
-----------------------------------------------------

Before you start running the NGINX image, you must modify settings of the configuration file. The ODC image package contains templates of the configuration file. You can copy a template to a local device and edit the configuration where necessary. The templates of the configuration file vary, depending on whether you have deployed a self-signed certificate. We recommend that you copy a template based on the deployment and modify the configuration where necessary. 

### Configure the configuration file that does not contain the self-signed certificate 

Run the following command to copy the configuration file from the image package to the host for editing. You can customize the copy path as needed, and replace the tilde (\~) with the local path of the configuration file:

```javascript
docker cp -a <odc_image_name>:/opt/odc/conf/nginx.conf.template  ~/<conf_local_path>
```



The following code shows a template of the configuration file. We recommend that you pay attention to the content that requires changes based on the comments.

### Configure the configuration file that contains a self-signed certificate

        }
    }

}
```


**Note**



You can modify the load balancing configurations to ensure sufficient proxy server timeout. The modification takes effect after you restart the NGINX proxy. 
We recommend that you set the `proxy_connect_timeout` parameter to a value of no longer than 75 seconds. For more information, see proxy_connect_timeout: http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_connect_timeout.

If you do not set the `proxy_next_upstream` parameter to off, the NGINX proxy will forward your requests to the next ODC node. In this case, you need to log on to ODC again, and cannot use features related to file upload and download, such as downloading the result set of an asynchronous task.

Start an image 
-----------------------------------

After the configuration file is modified locally, run the following command in the command-line tool to restart the NGINX image. The tilde (\~) indicates the local path of the configuration file.

```shell
docker run --network host --name nginx -v ～/<conf_local_path>:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf -v /etc/pki/nginx/:/etc/pki/nginx/ -d nginx
```

| --network host                                  | Specifies to use a network port of the host. You do not need to configure port mapping in this case.    If you do not want to directly use the port of the host, you can specify the mapping ports using the `-p` parameter. For example, `-p 8080:80` specifies to map port 8080 of the host to port 80 of the Docker container. Likewise, `-p 8443:443` specifies to map port 8443 of the host to port 443 of the Docker container. |
| --name nginx                                    | Sets the name of the container to nginx for easier management. You can use other names, for example, odc-nginx.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -v \~/\<conf_local_path\>:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf | Mounts the Docker container to the specified directory of the host and maps the local files of the host to the Docker container.  `<conf_local_path>` specifies a local path of the configuration file on the host, and then maps the configuration file to the /etc/nginx/nginx.conf file in the Docker container.                                                                                                                   |
