Overview 
=============================

OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) is an enterprise-level database development platform tailored for OceanBase Database. ODC adopts the mature browser/server architecture and is accessible through either the web or client version. This document describes the entire process of upgrading Web ODC. You do not need to upgrade the ODC client. You can directly install the latest version. 

Upgrade in single-node deployment mode 
-----------------------------------------------------------

If your ODC is deployed in single-node mode, you only need to upgrade ODC on the node to the new version.

Upgrade in high-availability deployment mode 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

If your ODC is deployed in high availability mode, you only need to upgrade ODC to the new version on all nodes in high-availability deployment mode. You can choose to upgrade the NGINX image to the latest version when you upgrade ODC applications in high-availability deployment mode.
