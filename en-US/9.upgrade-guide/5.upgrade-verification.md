Upgrade verification 
=========================================
#docslug#odc-enterprise/V3.3.1/upgrade-verification
After OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) is upgraded, you can use the IP address and port number (<http://IP:PORT> or <http://DOMAIN:PORT>) of the ODC host to access Web ODC in a browser. In the high-availability deployment mode, use the IP address and port number of the host where the NGINX proxy resides. 

After you log on to ODC, click Help Center in the upper-right corner of the connection list page. Then, click **About Developer Center** in the drop-down list, and a window appears. You can view the ODC version number in this window to check whether the upgrade is succeeded. For more information about the use of Web ODC, see User Guide (Web ODC).
