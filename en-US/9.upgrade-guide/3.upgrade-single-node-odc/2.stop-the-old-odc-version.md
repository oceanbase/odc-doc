Stop ODC of the earlier version 
====================================================

When upgrading OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) deployed in single-node mode, you need to stop running ODC of the earlier version after you update the MetaDB. 

**Procedure:** 

1. Run the `docker ps -a` statement in the command line tool of the host to view the running container. You can find the container ID of ODC of the earlier version in the `IMAGE` column (image name). The ID is the corresponding value in the `CONTAINER ID` column. Execution result:

   ```javascript
   C:\Users\ob>docker ps -a
   CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                      COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                      NAMES
   8bfecbc1cd03        acs-reg.alipay.com/oceanbase/obodc:2.0.1   "/bin/sh -c '/usr/bi..."   13 days ago         Up 13 days          80/tcp, 8080/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8989->8989/tcp   obodc
   ```

   

2. After you obtain the container ID, run the `docker stop <CONTAINER ID>;` command in the command-line tool to stop the ODC container of the earlier version. Execution result:

   ```javascript
   C:\Users\ob>docker stop 8bfecbc1cd03
   8bfecbc1cd03
   ```

   

3. Run the `docker rm <CONTAINER ID>;` command in the command-line tool to delete the ODC image of the earlier version and release the port occupied. Execution result:

   ```javascript
   C:\Users\ob>docker rm 8bfecbc1cd03
   8bfecbc1cd03
   ```
