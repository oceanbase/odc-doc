Preparations before upgrade 
================================================

Before you deploy OceanBase Developer Center (ODC), you must prepare the MetaDB and the server. 

MetaDB 
---------------------------

The MetaDB was created when you deploy Web ODC to store user data that is generated during operation. 

To upgrade ODC, you must reinitialize the MetaDB and run the ODC image of the target version. Before the upgrade, check the name of the MetaDB tenant, name of the cluster to which the tenant belongs, database name, username, and password. 

> **Note** <br>
> <li> ODC V3.3.0 and later versions provide management capabilities for enterprises, such as change process and operation audit. For Web ODC, the version of MetaDB must be OceanBase Database V2.2.76 or later. Otherwise, the startup will fail due to verification failures.</li>
> <li> For ODC V3.3.1 and later versions, there is no restriction on MetaDB versions.</li>
> <li> 2C8G or a higher configuration is recommended for the OceanBase tenant of MetaDB. A low configuration may cause performance problems.</li>

  




Server 
---------------------------

The server that runs Web ODC must be configured based on the number of ODC users:

* ≤ 20 ODC users: 4 CPU cores and 8 GB of memory;

  

* ≤ 100 ODC users: 4 CPU cores and 16 GB of memory;

  

* ≤ 500 ODC users: 8 CPU cores and 32 GB of memory;

  

* \> 500 ODC users: Adjust the resource specifications as needed.

  




The server that runs Web ODC must be configured with the preceding resource specifications. Therefore, you need to check the server before upgrading ODC. 

To upgrade ODC, you need to re-obtain and run the ODC image on the server. Make sure that Docker is installed and can run normally on the server before the upgrade.
