## Notification templates

ODC allows you to define notification templates separately in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and English. By default, the notification templates are in the Markdown format.

- Simplified Chinese

    ```markdown
    ### ODC ${taskType}-${taskStatus}
     - 任务ID: ${taskId}
     - 项目: ${projectName}
     - 数据库: ${databaseName}
     - 发起人: ${creatorName}
     - 触发时间: ${triggerTime}
    ```

- Traditional Chinese

    ```markdown
    ### ODC ${taskType}-${taskStatus}
     - 任務ID: ${taskId}
     - 項目: ${projectName}
     - 數據庫: ${databaseName}
     - 發起人: ${creatorName}
     - 觸發時間: ${triggerTime}
    ```

- English

    ```markdown
    ### ODC ${taskType}-${taskStatus}
     - task ID: ${taskId}
     - project: ${projectName}
     - database: ${databaseName}
     - creator: ${creatorName}
     - trigger time: ${triggerTime}
    ```

  The following table describes the supported labels.

## Notification throttling settings

The frequency to send notifications is limited on some notification platforms. For example, a custom DingTalk chatbot supports sending at most 20 notifications per minute. If this threshold is reached, the chatbot will be throttled for 10 minutes. If you receive a large number of messages within a short period of time, important messages may be missed.

Therefore, ODC provides the notification throttling feature. You can set the maximum number of notifications that can be sent per minute, hour, or day through a specific channel. You can select either of the following options to handle notifications when the specified threshold is exceeded.

- **Ignore**: Notifications generated after the specified threshold is exceeded are ignored and will not be resent. In this case, the notifications are in the **Ignore** state on the **Notification History** page.
- **Resend**: After the throttling period of time elapses, notifications generated after the specified threshold is exceeded are automatically resent. The notifications are in the **To Be Sent** state before being resent.
