# Configure a custom channel

This topic describes how to configure a custom channel.

## Parameters

The following table describes the parameters to be specified when **Channel Type** is **HTTP**.

| Parameter | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| Webhook URL | The destination URL for receiving notifications, which must start with `http://` or `https://`. |
| Proxy (optional) | The proxy server that sends notifications, in the format of `http://ip:port`. In the format, `ip` represents the IP address of the proxy server, and `port` represents the port that is assigned to send notifications. For example, if the IP address of the proxy server is `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx` and port 80 is assigned, you can set **Proxy** to `http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:80`. |
| Request Method | Select the request method as needed. The default value is `POST`. |
| Header | Enter the template for HTTP headers. Separate the parameters with semicolons (`;`), for example, `Content-Type:application/json;charset:utf-8`.|
| Body | Specify the template for the notification content. If this parameter is not specified, no HTTP body is used. You can use a template to reference variables. For the list of variables, see [Create a notification channel](100.create-notification-channel.md). |
| Response Verification | Responses vary depending on channels. You must configure the response verification information for ODC to accurately determine whether a notification is successfully sent. <ul><li>You must enter the response verification information as a JSON string. ODC will parse the fields in the JSON string and match them against the corresponding information in the body of the channel response. If all fields are successfully matched, ODC determines that the notification is successfully sent. </li><li>If you are not sure of the channel response, you can set it to `{}`. This way, ODC will always assume that the notifications are successfully sent. </li></ul> |

## Example

<img src="https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/431/950.notification-management/300.custom-notification-channel/1EN.png" width="900">

As shown in the preceding figure, if the task ID corresponding to the event is 10001, ODC will send a request similar to the following one to the specified webhook. The value of the `data` field is the generated notification.

```bash
curl -XPOST -H "Context-Type:application/json" -H "charset:utf-8" -H "appkey:xxxxxx" http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:80 -d '{"jsonrpc":" 2.0","params": {"output":" extend"},"auth":" *******","data":" ..." ,"task_id":" 10001"}'
```

If the received response contains the key-value pair `"message":" success"`, ODC considers that the notification is successfully sent.
