# Overview

This topic describes the concepts involved in configuring notification for a project in OceanBase Developer Center (ODC).

## Background information

Web ODC V4.2.4 allows a project member to add a notification channel to learn about changes in ticket events.

## Notification records

A notification record is the content generated by ODC based on related ticket events and notification rules.

On the **Notification History** tab, you can view all notifications generated in the current project. You can search for and sort notifications by ticket event, notification channel, effective time, push time, and push status.

## Notification channel

A notification channel is a channel for transferring notifications between different systems. ODC allows you to configure DingTalk, Lark, WeCom, or a custom webhook as a notification channel.

On the **Notification Channels** tab, you can create, edit, view, and delete notification channels. You can also search for and sort notification channels by name, type, or creation time.

## Notification rules

A notification rule is the metadata of notification. A notification rule consists of the following parts:

- Event: indicates the change in the approval or execution status of the ticket.

- Enabling status: indicates whether the current notification rule is enabled.

- Notification channel: indicates the notification channel bound with the current notification rule.

Assume that a notification rule bound with one or more notification channels is enabled. When a corresponding event is triggered, ODC will generate notifications based on the configurations of the bound channels and send the notifications through the channels.
