# View notification records

This topic describes how to view notification details.

## Notification record list

Log on to the OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) console. Choose **Projects** > **Notification**. On the **Notification History** tab that automatically appears, you can specify search criteria to filter the notifications.

- You can search for and sort notifications by ticket event, notification channel, effective time, push time, and push status.

- If the push of a notification is interrupted due to reasons such as throttling or network failure, ODC will resend the notification three times until it is successfully sent. The push status and last push time are information of the notification when it is last sent.
