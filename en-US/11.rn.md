## Fixed issues 

* Database objects

   * In OceanBase Database in MySQL mode, the window gets stuck if you do not have the permission to access table schemas.

   * The SQL statement generated when you rename a constraint is empty.


* Execution of PL\SQL statements

   * After the execution of PL\SQL statements times out, no error message is returned and reconnection is not automatically prompted.

   * In some cases, the execution of PL\SQL statements leads to the report of a null pointer exception.

   * Parameters whose values are set to `NULL` or `default` cannot be recognized during the PL debugging.

* Import and export

   * The database connection cannot be released in some import and export tasks.

   * An error occurs in the result set when you export the DATETIME type.

   * The exported result set cannot be desensitized.


* Database changes

   * Data of the YEAR and DATETIME types is incorrectly displayed in a database change task.

   * The rollback step of a scheduled database change task may not be executed.

   * The following error may be returned when you query the execution result of a scheduled database change task: `query result file not found`.

   * The downloaded query results of a database change task before and after the rollback are inconsistent.

* Connection management

   * The connection cannot be created due to the failure of the connectivity test in some cases.

   * You can connect OceanBase Database in MySQL mode to native MySQL Database, but an error message is returned.

* Partitioning plans

   * When you create a partition plan, deleted partitioned tables may be displayed in the scan results.


* Collaborative control

   * In multi-node deployment mode, OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) sometimes cannot synchronize with the status of external approval integration.

   * The error message indicating that a connection does not have the corresponding approval process is not available in multiple languages.

   * An error is returned for the verification of read and write permissions on a public connection.


* Other modules

   * When ODC forwards a request in multi-node deployment mode, it may lead to a recursive call.

   * If an object has special characters in its name, it cannot be restored from the recycle bin.



## Known issues

* The floating-point precision is lost when exporting Float data.

* The ODC client cannot be installed in a directory whose name contains Chinese characters.

* The exported data file and content are incorrectly displayed when the table contains virtual columns.

* The SQL statement generated is incorrect because not all primary partition keys are included in the global unique index.

* In web ODC, the maximum size of schema or data imported in a batch cannot exceed 2 GB, and files that exceed the limit cannot be uploaded.


* In web ODC, the maximum size of schema or data exported in a batch cannot exceed 2 GB. Exceeding the limit will cause the final export data to be incomplete.

* OceanBase Database Enterprise Version V4.0.0 and OceanBase Database Community Edition V4.0.0 do not support data import or export.

* In the details of an export task, the total number of data records of the exported object depends on the views of OceanBase Database and is not an accurate value.

* The `ob_enable_trace_log` parameter must be set to `on`. Otherwise, only the execution plan of the first executed SQL statement will be displayed.
