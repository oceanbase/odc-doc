| No. | Operation | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1 | [Deploy ODC on a single node](../200.web-odc-quickstart/200.quickstart-deployment-odc.md) | Deploy ODC on a single node. All user requests are processed by this node.  |
| 1 | Log on to Web ODC | Log on to Web ODC. Subsequent operations, such as configuring data sources for databases and saving SQL scripts in the workspace, are performed based on the logon user.  |
| 2 | [Manage users](300.quickstart-using-web-odc.md) | Add users and grant data source permissions based on user roles.   |
| 3 | Create a data source | Establish a connection between ODC and OceanBase Database to edit and manage database objects and resources.  |
| 4 | Create a project | Create a project for teamwork and security management. <br>A project consists of project members, databases, and tickets. A project member operates a database on which the member has the access permission in the SQL window or by submitting a ticket. The submitted ticket is reviewed by specified project members or does not need to be reviewed based on the management strategy of the database.  |
| 5 | Add a database to the project | Select a database from the data sources created in ODC and add it to the project.  |
| 6 | Write and execute an SQL statement | Write and execute an SQL statement in the SQL window of ODC.   |
| 7 | Create a database change task | Create a database change task to change data in the database.   |

After you finish the preceding steps, you can develop and manage your OceanBase database in Web ODC.
