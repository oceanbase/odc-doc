### Workspace

![2](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/420/200.overview/600.odc-console/workspace-en.png)

Click Workspace to switch between the team workspace and individual workspace.

- **Team Workspace**: supports multiple projects and members. It provides unified control rules to improve the collaboration efficiency of project teams and secure changes to data sources.

- **Individual Workspace**: supports flexible management of personal data sources without complex control rules and restrictions.


### Project

![3](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/420/200.overview/600.odc-console/project-en.png)

Users with project administrator permissions can create multiple projects and members. Members of the same project can perform collaborative control on databases, tickets, members, and sensitive data in the project.


### Data source

![4](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/420/200.overview/600.odc-console/datasource-en.png)

You can connect ODC to an OceanBase database. After the connection is successfully established, you can edit and manage the connected data sources, including the database objects and resources, in ODC.


### Command-line window

![9](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/420/200.overview/600.odc-console/cli-en.png)

In the command-line window, you can directly execute SQL or PL statements and view the results in real time. You can also run files uploaded to the server by using the `SOURCE` command.


### Ticket

![5](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/420/200.overview/600.odc-console/ticket-en.png)

In ODC, you can submit tickets to apply for data export, data import, data mocking, database change, lock-free structure changes, scheduled SQL plan execution, and scheduled data archiving. You can also approve tickets in ODC.

### User permissions

![6](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/420/200.overview/600.odc-console/permission-en.png)

Users with the ODC system administrator role can add users to teams and add roles to users to grant resource management and system operation permissions. They can also set automatic authorization rules to automatically grant specific roles or permissions to users that meet the specified conditions upon initial logon or creation. This avoids repeated authorization operations.


### Security specifications

![7](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/420/200.overview/600.odc-console/security-en.png)

You can set and manage environments, risk levels, risk identification rules, desensitization algorithms, approval processes, and operation records in security specifications.

### External integration

![8](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/420/200.overview/600.odc-console/integration-en.png)

ODC allows to integrate external approval systems into ODC. To do so, you can integrate the custom code of the external systems on the **Approval Integration** and **SQL Approval Integration** tabs of the **External Integration** page. Then, ODC calls the APIs that you configured for external approval process management and SQL interception checks.

You can also configure single sign-on (SSO) of the OpenID Connect (OIDC) or OAuth2 type for ODC on the **SSO Integration** tab of the **External Integration** page.


### Help

![9](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/420/200.overview/600.odc-console/help-en.png)

You can click **Help** in the lower-left corner of the ODC homepage to view the operation tutorials, new features, and FAQ of ODC.

Click the desired document on the tab. The introduction information and redirect link of the document are then displayed in the window that appears.

### Me

![10](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/420/200.overview/600.odc-console/me-en.png)

On the **Me** page, you can change the password, modify the language, configure preferences, view operating records, and exit ODC.
