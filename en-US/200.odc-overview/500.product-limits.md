# Limitations

This topic describes the environment requirements for installing and deploying OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) and the limitations on each feature.

## Environment requirements for web ODC

### Hardware requirements

ODC supports both single-node and multi-node deployment. The following table lists the minimum hardware requirements for a single ODC node.

| Hardware | Requirement |
|------|------|
| CPU | 64-bit x86 or ARM processor, 2 cores or more  |
| Memory | 4 GB or more  |

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
   <h4>Note</h4>
   <ul>
   <li>To implement the high availability feature of web ODC, you must deploy multiple ODC servers. For more information, see <a href="../16.deployment-guide/4.deploy-the-ha-odc/1.ha-odc-deployment-process.md">Deploy high-availability ODC</a>. </li>
   <li>ODC provides a container image to implement lightweight deployment. Make sure that Docker is installed on the server so that you can pull and run the image. </li>
   </ul>
</main>

### Software requirements

#### OS requirements

The following table lists the OS requirements for an ODC server.

| Operating system | Supported version |
|----------|--------|
| Linux | <ul><li>CentOS 7.2 and later </li><li>AliOS 7.2 and later </li><li>Huawei EulerOS 2.0 SP8 </li></ul> |

#### Docker requirements

OceanBase Database versions whose PL-related features are supported by ODC

| Feature | Supported version |
|--------|-----------------------|
| Compilation of PL functions, stored procedures, and packages, debugging of PL functions and stored procedures, and debugging of anonymous blocks | OceanBase Database V2.2.7x, V3.0.0, and later  |
| Running of anonymous blocks and PL functions, stored procedures, and packages | OceanBase Database V2.0.x and later  |

### Database connection

- A session-sharing design is used in database connections in Oracle mode. When you commit or roll back a transaction, or trigger a transaction either by creating, modifying, or deleting a database object, or by executing a DDL statement, the transaction takes effect on all windows.

- When you manually commit a transaction, you must set `ob_trx_idle_timeout` to a value that is larger than the timeout value of SQL queries. Otherwise, if a transaction takes longer than `ob_trx_idle_timeout` to execute before the next transaction starts, the connection will be terminated. However, if the `ob_trx_idle_timeout` parameter is set to an excessively large value, the session cannot be released in time, resulting in unnecessary memory consumption. Therefore, you must set this parameter to a proper value.

### Workspace

- The anonymous block window can be created only in Oracle mode.

- The debugging feature is unavailable when you use ODP to connect to an OceanBase Database instance. To use this feature, directly connect ODC to the target instance.

- You have installed the debugging packages such as DBMS_DEBUG and DBMS_OUTPUT in the connected database.

- Only OceanBase Databbase V2.2.70, V3.0.00, and later versions support the debugging of PL objects. Currently, OceanBase Databbase supports only debugging in an x86 environment, but not in an ARM environment.

- In ODC, multiple identical connections share one single session. By default, in ODC V2.3.2 and later, automatic committing is disabled in Oracle mode. You must manually commit transactions.

### Data import and export

* OceanBase Database V2.2.30 and later versions support the UTF8, GBK, GB18030, and UTF16 character sets. Instances earlier than OceanBase Database V2.2.30 support only UTF8.

* In ODC V2.2.0 and later, you can use the import and export feature only when ODC is connected to the target OceanBase Database instance by using ODP. In ODC of earlier versions, you can use this feature regardless of whether ODP is used.

* The maximum size of data exported in one batch in web ODC cannot exceed 2 GB before compression. To export data of a larger size, use the data export tool OBDUMPER.

* The maximum size of files imported in one batch in web ODC cannot exceed 2 GB after compression. To import data of a larger size, use the data import tool OBLOADER.

* ODC allows you to run up to three import or export tasks in parallel. Subsequent tasks will wait in the queue.

* In versions later than ODC V2.4.1, you can configure the sys tenant account to improve the export and import speed. If you selected objects other than tables and views during an export, you must configure this item to use the sys tenant account for the export.

### Database objects

* Currently, you cannot modify existing indexes in a table.

* You can create sequence and package objects only in Oracle mode.

* To view partitioning information, you must set a sys account that has read privileges in advanced settings when you create a session.
