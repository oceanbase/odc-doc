# Limitations

This topic describes the environment requirements for deploying OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) and the limitations on each feature module.

## Environment requirements for deploying Web ODC

### Hardware requirements

ODC supports single-node deployment and multi-node high availability deployment. The following table lists the minimum hardware requirements for a single ODC node.

| Hardware | Requirement |
|------|------|
| CPU | X86 or ARM architecture, 64-bit processor with two or more cores  |
| Memory | 4 GB or higher  |

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
   <h4>Note</h4>
   <ul>
   <li>To achieve high availability for Web ODC, you must deploy Web ODC on multiple nodes. For more information, see <a href="../1100.deployment-guide/400.deploy-the-ha-odc/100.ha-odc-deployment-process.md">Deploy ODC in high availability mode</a>. </li>
   <li>To enable the lightweight deployment, ODC uses a container image. Make sure that Docker is installed on the server so that you can pull and run the image. </li>
   </ul>
</main>

The following table lists the data sources supported by ODC.

| Database type | Supported versions |
|-----------|-----------|
| OceanBase Database | <ul><li> OceanBase Database V1.4.x</li><li> OceanBase Database V2.0.x</li><li> OceanBase Database V2.1.x</li><li> OceanBase Database V2.2.x</li><li> OceanBase Database V3.1.x</li><li> OceanBase Database V3.2.x</li>   <li>OceanBase Database V4.0.0 </li>   <li>OceanBase Database V4.1.0</li><li>OceanBase Database V4.2.0</li><li>OceanBase Database V4.2.1</li><li>OceanBase Database Community Edition (PL features not supported)</li></ul> |

The following table describes the PL features that ODC supports for OceanBase Database of different versions.

| Feature | Supported versions |
|--------|-----------------------|
| Compilation of PL functions, stored procedures, and packages, debugging of PL functions and stored procedures, and debugging of anonymous blocks | OceanBase Database V2.2.7x, V3.0.0, and later  |
| Running of anonymous blocks and PL functions, stored procedures, and packages | OceanBase Database V2.0.x and later  |

### Database connections

- Oracle connections are designed to share one session. Whether you commit or roll back a transaction, or trigger a transaction either by creating, modifying, or deleting a database object, or by executing a DDL statement, the transaction takes effect on all windows.

- In manual-commit mode, make sure to set `ob_trx_idle_timeout` to a value greater than the timeout value of SQL queries. Otherwise, if two SQL statements in one transaction are executed at an interval longer than the value of `ob_trx_idle_timeout`, the connection will be terminated. However, if the `ob_trx_idle_timeout` parameter is set to an excessively large value, the session cannot be released in time, resulting in unnecessary memory consumption. Therefore, you must set this parameter to a proper value.

### Workspace

- The anonymous block window is available only in Oracle mode.

- The debugging feature is unavailable when you use OBProxy to connect to an instance. Connect to the target instance directly in ODC.

- You have installed the debugging packages such as DBMS_DEBUG and DBMS_OUTPUT in the connected database.

- ODC supports debugging of PL objects only for connections to OceanBase Database of V2.2.70, V3.0.00, and later in an x86 environment.

- In ODC, multiple identical connections share one single session. In ODC V2.3.2 and later, the auto-commit feature is disabled by default in Oracle mode. Therefore, you must manually commit transactions.

### Data import and export

* OceanBase Database V2.2.30 or later supports the following character sets: UTF8, GBK, GB18030, and UTF16. OceanBase Database of a version earlier than V2.2.30 supports only UTF8.

* In ODC V2.2.0 and later, you can use the import and export feature when the target instance is directly connected to ODC or by using an OBProxy.

* Web ODC allows you to export at most 2 GB of data (before compression) at a time. To export data of a larger size, use the data export tool OBDUMPER.

* Web ODC allows you to import files sized at most 2 GB (after compression) at a time. To import data of a larger size, use the data import tool OBLOADER.

* ODC allows you to run at most three import or export tasks in parallel. Subsequent tasks will wait in the queue.

* In ODC of a version later than V2.4.1, you can configure the sys tenant account to speed up export and import. If you select objects other than tables and views during export, you must configure the sys tenant account.

### Database objects

* Currently, you cannot modify indexes that are already created in a table.

* You can create sequence and package objects only in Oracle mode.

* To view partition information, you must log on as the SYS user that has the read permission on partition information. Therefore, you must configure the SYS user in **Advanced Configuration** when you create the connection.

### Data archiving

* A cluster instance (specified by the cluster name) must be configured for a data source.

* A data source must be connected through a proxy. Direct connection is not supported.

* The sys tenant must be configured in a public cloud environment other than Alibaba Cloud.

* OceanBase Database V4.1.0 does not support data archiving.

* Data archiving is supported only for OceanBase Database in MySQL mode.

* Only tables with a primary key can be archived.

* Data of the BIT, ENUM, or SET type cannot be archived.

* Data archiving is not supported if the filter condition contains the LIMIT clause.

* Tables with a foreign key cannot be archived.

### Automatic generation of SQL statements for rollback

* SQL statements for rollback can be generated only for UPDATE and DELETE operations.

* In MySQL mode of OceanBase Database, no SQL statement for rollback can be generated for an UPDATE or DELETE operation performed on a table without a primary key or unique key.

* No SQL statement for rollback can be generated for a change operation performed on a table with LOB fields.

* If more than 1 million rows are affected in a database change task that requires a backup rollback plan, the plan will fail to be generated.

* The size of a backup rollback plan file cannot exceed 256 MB, which is same as the maximum size of an SQL script that can be uploaded for a database change task.

* For OceanBase Database in Oracle mode, ODC cannot execute the DELETE statement that is generated when the UPDATE statement is executed and the fields in the UPDATE SET and WHERE fields are the same.

### Dynamic desensitization

* Groovy supports only the Objects and String classes in Java.

* Groovy closures and inherent closure functions are not supported.

### SSO integration

* Only the authorization-code mode is supported.

* After a user logs off, only the logon state in ODC is cleared. The logon state in the single sign-on (SSO) system is not cleared.

* The name of a mapped column must be of the String type.
