## Limitations on using features

### Permission limitations

- To perform debugging in OceanBase Database V4.0.0 and later, make sure that you have the debugging permission. You can execute the `GRANT DEBUG CONNECT SESSION TO <user>` or `GRANT DEBUG ANY PROCEDURE TO <user>` statement to grant the debugging permission.

- In ODC of a version earlier than V4.1.3-bp4, a user configured in an OceanBase MySQL data source must have the mysql.proc permission. Otherwise, an error occurs when the user views functions or stored procedures in the data source.

- In ODC of a version earlier than V4.1.0, if you want to export objects other than tables and views from an OceanBase data source or if you want to ensure the export speed, you must configure a sys tenant account that has query permissions on the sys tenant.

- In ODC V4.1.0 and later, if you want to ensure the export speed for an OceanBase data source, you must configure a sys tenant account.

### Session limitations

- ODC of a version earlier than V4.2.0 supports the shared session mode. In shared session mode, all windows in a connection share a session. If you trigger a commit or rollback operation in any window, including implicit commit scenarios, for example, if you create, modify, or delete a database object schema or execute a DDL statement, the commit or rollback operation affects all windows. For more information about the shared session and independent session modes, see [How do I change the session mode in the SQL window?](../1300.troubleshooting/400.faq/300.connection-information-faq.md).

- In ODC of a version later than V2.3.2, by default, transactions need to be manually committed in OceanBase Database in Oracle mode. To change the transaction commit mode, see [How do I change the transaction commit mode?](../1300.troubleshooting/400.faq/300.connection-information-faq.md).

- ODC supports the manual commit and autocommit modes. In manual commit mode, you must set the `ob_trx_idle_timeout` parameter to an appropriate value for an OceanBase data source. This is to prevent a connection from being terminated because the execution interval between two SQL statements in a transaction exceeds the value of `ob_trx_idle_timeout`. Generally, the value of the `ob_trx_idle_timeout` parameter must be greater than the timeout value of SQL queries. If you specify an excessively large value for this parameter, the memory resources occupied by this session cannot be released in a timely manner. Proceed with caution.

### PL limitations

The following table lists the PL support information of ODC.

| Feature | Supported object | Supported data source | Supported version |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Compilation | Functions, stored procedures, and packages | OceanBase Oracle<br>OB Cloud Oracle | V2.2.7x and V3.0.0 and later  |
| Debugging | Functions, stored procedures, and anonymous blocks | OceanBase Oracle | V3.2.3 and later  |
| Running | Functions and stored procedures | OceanBase Oracle<br>OB Cloud Oracle<br>OceanBase MySQL<br>OB Cloud MySQL | V2.0.x and later  |
|  | Functions and stored procedures | MySQL | V5.7 |
| Running | Packages and anonymous blocks | OceanBase Oracle<br>OB Cloud Oracle | V2.0.x and later  |

Pay attention to the following rules:

- If the data source is an OceanBase cluster instance, you must connect to it by using OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP). This instance does not support debugging.

- The anonymous block window is displayed only for OceanBase Oracle and OB Cloud Oracle data sources.

- ODC of a version earlier than V3.2.3 does not support debugging in the advanced RISC machine (ARM) architecture.

### Limitations on SQL development

- You cannot edit a result set that contains the SET or ENUM field type.

### Limitations on import and export

- The maximum size of data exported in one batch in ODC cannot exceed 2 GB before compression. To export data of a larger size, use the data export tool OBDUMPER.

- The maximum size of files imported in one batch in Web ODC cannot exceed 2 GB after compression. To import data of a larger size, use the data import tool OBLOADER.

- At most five concurrent import/export tasks are supported. Subsequent tasks need to wait in the queue.

- By default, files related to import/export tasks are retained for 14 days.

- In ODC of a version later than V4.1.0, you can configure a sys tenant account for an OceanBase data source to increase the import/export speed. When you export objects other than tables and views, a sys tenant account is no longer a must.

### Limitations on change rollback

- A rollback statement can be automatically generated only for the UPDATE and DELETE statements.

- A change task is allowed to affect a maximum of 1 million rows. If the number of affected rows exceeds 1 million, a rollback statement cannot be automatically generated for this change task.

- If the table contains LOB fields, a rollback statement cannot be automatically generated.

- If the table does not have a primary or unique key when the data source is an OceanBase MySQL or a MySQL data source, a rollback statement cannot be automatically generated.

- If the `SET` and `WHERE` clauses in an `UPDATE` statement are the same, a rollback statement cannot be automatically generated.

- The maximum size of a rollback script that is automatically generated is 256 MB.

### Limitations on partitioning plans

- Only OceanBase MySQL data sources are supported.

- Only RANGE-partitioned tables that are partitioned based on a Timestamp-type field and RANGE COLUMNS-partitioned tables that are partitioned based on a Date-type field are supported.

### Limitations on data mocking

- At most 100 million rows can be mocked at a time.

- Data mocking is not supported for a table with `CHECK` constraints.

- Data mocking is not supported for a table that is encoded by using ZHSGB2312.

### Limitations on command-line windows

- Client ODC that runs on macOS does not provide a command-line window.

- You can open at most three command-line windows.

- Operations performed in a command-line window are not recorded.

### Limitations on data archiving

- Pay attention to the following rules:

   - You must connect to an OceanBase data source by using ODP. At present, you cannot archive data in a directly connected OceanBase data source.

   - At present, an OceanBase data source must be a cluster instance. Therefore, you must configure the cluster instance name when you create an OceanBase data source.

   - If the data sources of the source and destination are of different types, the destination table cannot be automatically created.

   - Make sure that the fields in the source table are compatible with those at the destination. The data archiving service does not handle field compatibility issues.

   - CPU and memory exhaustion prevention is not supported for a MySQL data source.

- The following archive links are supported:

   - Links between MySQL tenants of OceanBase Database

   - Links between MySQL databases

   - Links from a MySQL database to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database

   - Links from a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database to a MySQL database

- Data archiving is not supported in the following cases:

   - The source table does not have a primary key.

   - The source table contains fields of the bit, enum, set, xml, or geometry data type.

   - The archiving condition contains a LIMIT clause.

   - The source table contains a foreign key.

### Limitations on data cleanup

- Pay attention to the following rules:

   - You must connect to an OceanBase data source by using ODP. At present, you cannot archive data in a directly connected OceanBase data source.

   - At present, an OceanBase data source must be a cluster instance. Therefore, you must configure the cluster instance name when you create an OceanBase data source.

   - CPU and memory exhaustion prevention is not supported for a MySQL data source.

- Supported data sources for data cleanup are as follows:

   - OceanBase MySQL data sources

   - MySQL data sources

- Data cleanup is not supported in the following cases:

   - The table does not have a primary key.

   - The table contains fields of the bit, enum, set, xml, or geometry type.

   - The archiving condition contains a LIMIT clause.

   - The table contains a foreign key.

### Limitations on data desensitization

- Data desensitization is not supported in command-line windows.

- Data desensitization is not supported during PL execution.

- When you configure an identification rule script, Groovy supports only the Objects and String classes in Java.

- When you configure an identification rule script, Groovy closures and inherent closure functions are not supported.

- If sensitive data is involved when you export data from a MySQL data source, the mask all algorithm is used for desensitization.

### Limitations on lock-free schema changes

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
   <h4>Notice</h4>
   <p>Lock-free schema change tasks are supported only in OceanBase Database Community Edition and ApsaraDB for OceanBase. </p>
</main>

- The table contains a primary key or a non-null unique key, and does not contain a foreign key.

- The table name does not exceed 54 characters in length in MySQL mode of OceanBase Database, and does not exceed 118 characters in Oracle mode.

- When ODC connects to an instance of OceanBase Database Community Edition, the data source configuration information must contain the cluster name and a sys tenant account.

- In Oracle mode of OceanBase Database of a version earlier than V4.0.0 or MySQL mode of OceanBase Database of a version earlier than V4.3.0, ODC locks the user and closes the session to prevent data writes during table name switching.

- If you execute other DDL operations on a table on which a lock-free schema change task is being performed, the task will fail.
