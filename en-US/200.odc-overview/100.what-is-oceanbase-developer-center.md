# What is ODC?

OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) is a GUI-based database development tool. It is also a collaborative management platform for data development, production, and changes. ODC is provided in two forms: client ODC and web ODC. Client ODC focuses on database development. It is lightweight and easy to deploy on Windows, macOS, and Linux. As for web ODC, in addition to database development, web ODC also provides collaborative management features to ensure the security, compliance, and efficiency of database changes.

Web ODC allows you to work in Individual Workspace mode and Team Workspace mode. Individual Workspace is suitable for individual developers and allows you to use features of client ODC in a browser. You can access and create data sources as needed and develop databases with various windows and tools provided on the platform. Team Workspace is ideal for developers and database administrators (DBAs) to collaborate with each other. It is both a development tool and a collaborative management platform. ODC provides a variety of database development and management features, such as project collaboration, stable change, data security, and hot/cold data separation.
