Session management 
=======================================
#docslug#/oceanbase-developer-center/odc/V3.3.1/.web-odc-session-management
A session is a connection between an application and a database. On the Session Management page of OceanBase Developer Center (ODC), you can view the details of all the sessions connected to the current database. The Session Properties page of ODC provides a graphical interface where you can view and modify the session variables and global variables that the current database supports. 

After you enter a database connection in ODC, click **Session** in the top navigation bar and then choose **Session properties** or **Session management** to go to the corresponding page.

The session properties are database variables. OceanBase Database provides two types of variables: session variables and global variables.

* **Session variables** : When a client connects to a database, the database copies the global variables to automatically generate session variables. The modification of session variables takes effect on the current session only.

* **Global variables** : Global variables are shared by all the instances of a database. These variables are shared among different users. When you modify a global variable, the database saves the modification, which remains valid after you disconnect from and reconnects to the database.



**Note**



* The current ODC version does not allow you to edit global variables. You can modify session variables.

  

* In ODC, multiple identical connections share one single session. In ODC V2.3.2 and later versions, auto-commit is turned off by default in Oracle mode, so you need to manually commit transactions. You can modify the value of the autocommit parameter to change this setting.

  

* In manual-commit mode, make sure to set ob_trx_idle_timeout to a value greater than the timeout duration of SQL queries. Otherwise, if two SQL statements in one transaction are executed at an interval longer than the value of ob_trx_idle_timeout, the connection will be terminated. However, if ob_trx_idle_timeout is set to an excessively large value, the session cannot be released in time, resulting in unnecessary memory consumption. Therefore, you need to set this parameter to a proper value.

  




ODC provides a graphical interface where you can view and modify the variables that the current database supports. Take note of the following items related to the modification of variables:

* In the current ODC version, session variables have two modes: display mode and edit mode. To modify a variable, select the variable and click Edit in the toolbar to go to the editing page. After you edit a variable, click **OK** . On the SQL Confirmation page, click **Execute** to apply the modification.

  

* To modify a variable of a character or numeric type, you can directly enter the new value on the Edit page.

  

* To modify a variable of an enumeration type, ODC lists the values that the variable supports in the edit box. This allows you to modify the variable in a graphical interface without having to memorize its name or value, which saves your memorization efforts and increases the efficiency of variable modification.

  




Session management 
---------------------------------------

A session is a connection between an application and a database. On the Session Management page, you can view all the sessions connected to the current database and the following session information:


|    Information     |                             Description                             |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Session ID         | The ID that uniquely identifies the current session.                |
| User               | The username used to log on to the database in the current session. |
| Source             | The address from which the session is initiated.                    |
| Database name      | The name of the database accessed in the session.                   |
| Status             | The state of the session. Valid values: **SLEEP** and **ACTIVE** .  |
| Command            | The type of the command being executed in the session.              |
| Execution Time (s) | The time in seconds spent on executing the current SQL query.       |
| SQL                | The actual SQL query being executed in the session.                 |
| OBProxy            | The address of the proxy used for the session.                      |

The Session Management page provides the following buttons in the navigation bar for you to manage sessions.

* **Refresh** : Click this button to refresh the session list.

* **Close Session** : Click this button to terminate the current session.

* **Close current query processes of the session** : Click this button to terminate the ongoing SQL execution processes in the session.
