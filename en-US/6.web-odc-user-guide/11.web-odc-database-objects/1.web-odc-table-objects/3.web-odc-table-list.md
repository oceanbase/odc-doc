Table list 
===============================

Log on to OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) and click the name of the target connection to go to the corresponding connection management page. You can click **Table** in the left-side navigation pane to get a list of tables. The table list displays the table objects in the connected database. In the table list, you can view the structure tree of an object. You can also right-click the target object to perform some management actions on the object. 

Structure tree 
-----------------------------------

You can click the expand icon before the name of the target table in the table list, and the structure tree of the table is displayed in a drop-down list, as shown in the following figure. The structure tree of a table can have up to three levels. When you right-click an item in the tree, the shortcut menu displays some actions that you can perform on the item. For more information about these actions, see the **Management actions** section. In this section, you can find the table describing the management options.

The names of table objects support ascending example by head character by default in the table list.
Right-click the target object in the structure tree. A shortcut menu appears, displaying some management options provided by ODC for you to conveniently manage the target object. The following table describes the management options.
