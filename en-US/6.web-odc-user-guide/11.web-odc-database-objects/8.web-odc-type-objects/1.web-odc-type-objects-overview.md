Overview 
=============================

You can create custom object types in OceanBase Database. A type in OceanBase Database is similar to a class in Java. A class has attributes and methods, and methods in Java are equivalent to functions and stored procedures in OceanBase Database. 

Log on to OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) and click the name of the target connection to go to the corresponding connection management page. Click Type in the left-side navigation pane to get a list of types. Click the **+** button in the upper-right corner of the list to go to the type creation page. You can double-click the name of a type in the list to go to the type management page, where you can view the basic information and code of the type. 
**Notice**



After you connect ODC to OceanBase Database V2.2.20 or a later version in Oracle mode, you can create type objects in ODC. The MySQL mode does not support this feature.

This chapter describes in different topics the operations you can perform on type objects in ODC.
