Manage program packages 
============================================

Log on to OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) and click the name of the target connection to go to the corresponding connection management page. You can click **Program Package** in the left-side navigation pane to get a list of program package objects in the current database. 

In the program package list, you can view the **structure tree** of an object. You can also right-click the target object to perform some **management actions** on the object. You can also double-click the name of a program package to go to the program package page, which provides a **Package Header** tab and a **Package Body** tab. 

Structure tree 
-----------------------------------

You can click the Expand icon before the name of the target program package in the program package list. Then, the structure tree of the program package displayed in a drop-down list, as shown in the following figure. The structure tree of a program package can have up to six levels. When you right-click an item in the tree, the shortcut menu displays some actions that you can perform on the item. For more information about these actions, see the **Management actions** section, where you can find the table describing the management options.
