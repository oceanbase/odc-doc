A synonym is an alias of a database object. It is often used to simplify object access and improve the security of object access. Similar to views, synonyms do not consume storage space, and only the synonym definitions are stored in the data dictionary. Synonyms are divided into public synonyms and common synonyms. 

Log on to OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) and click the name of the target connection to go to the corresponding connection management page. You can click Synonym in the left-side navigation pane to get a list of synonyms. You can click **+** in the upper-right corner of the list to go to the synonym creation page. You can also double-click a synonym name in the list to go to the synonym management page. On this page, you can view the basic information and codes of the synonym. 

The database version must meet the following requirements:


|             Database              |          Version          |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| OceanBase Database in Oracle mode | V2.2.0 or a later version |
| OceanBase Database in MySQL mode  | V2.2.0 or a later version |
