In the view list, you can view the **[structure tree](#structure-tree)** of an object. You can also right-click the target object to perform some **[management actions](#management-actions)** on the object. You can also double-click the name of the target view to go to the view management page, which includes the **[Attribute and Data tabs](#attribute)** . 

Structure tree

You can click the expand icon before the name of the target view in the view list, and the structure tree of the view is displayed in a drop-down list, as shown in the following figure. The structure tree of a view can have up to three levels. When you right-click an item in the tree, the shortcut menu displays some actions that you can perform on the item. For more information about these actions, see the **[Management actions](#management-actions)** section, where you can find the table describing the management options.
