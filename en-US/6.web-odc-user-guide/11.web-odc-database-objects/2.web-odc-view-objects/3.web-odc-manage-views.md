Manage views 
=================================

Log on to OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) and click the name of the target connection to go to the corresponding connection management page. You can click **View** in the left-side navigation pane to get a list of views in the current database. 

In the view list, you can view the **structure tree** of an object. You can also right-click the target object to perform some **management actions** on the object. You can also double-click the name of the target view to go to the view management page, which includes the **Attribute and Data tabs** . 

Structure tree 
-----------------------

You can click the expand icon before the name of the target view in the view list, and the structure tree of the view is displayed in a drop-down list, as shown in the following figure. The structure tree of a view can have up to three levels. When you right-click an item in the tree, the shortcut menu displays some actions that you can perform on the item. For more information about these actions, see the **Management actions** section, where you can find the table describing the management options.
