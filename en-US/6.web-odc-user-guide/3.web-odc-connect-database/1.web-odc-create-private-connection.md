Create a private connection 
================================================



Overview 
-----------------------------

After you log on to the homepage of OceanBase Developer Center (ODC), you can click **Create Connection** in the upper-right corner of the **Private Connection** tab to create a private connection.

After you create the connection, you can view the saved database connection in the connection list on the ODC homepage.

> **Notice** <br> 
> <li> In ODC V2.3.0 and later versions, the root@sys user permissions are required to query views when you use the import and export features. Therefore, to use the import and export features, you need to set the root@sys user in the Advanced Configuration section during connection creation.</li>
> <li> The root@sys user permissions are also required to view the partition information. Therefore, to display the table partition information, you must also set the root@sys user in the Advanced Configuration section during connection creation.</li>
> <li> ODC V3.3.0 and later versions support independent sessions and shared sessions. In independent session mode, each SQL window corresponds to one database session, and all modifications affect only the current window. In shared session mode, all SQL windows share one database session, and modifications in any SQL window affect other SQL windows.</li>
> <li> In manual-commit mode, make sure to set the `ob_trx_idle_timeout` parameter to a value greater than or equal to the timeout value of SQL queries. Otherwise, if two SQL statements in one transaction are executed at an interval longer than the value of the `ob_trx_idle_timeout` parameter, the connection is terminated. However, if the `ob_trx_idle_timeout` parameter is set to an excessively large value, the session cannot be released in time, resulting in unnecessary memory consumption. Therefore, you must set this parameter to a proper value.</li>

  




Procedure 
------------------------------

Perform the following steps to create a connection:

1. Log on to ODC and click **Create Connection** in the upper-right corner of the **Private Connection** tab.

   

2. In the Create Connection panel, specify the fields described in the following table. If you have an OceanBase connection string, which follows the mysql -h **\<host name\>** -P **\<port number\>** -u **\<database username@tenant name\>** # **\<cluster name\>** -D **\<default database\>** -p ' **\<database password\>** ' format, you can obtain the information from the string. You can also paste the string in the field of Intelligent Parsing on the panel to automatically populate the corresponding fields.

   | Endpoint                | * **Host Name** : the IP address of the server where the target database is located.   * **Port** : the port number of the server where the target database is located.   * **Cluster** : the name of the cluster where the target database is located. This parameter is not required for logical databases.   * **Tenant** : the name of the tenant in which the target database is located. This parameter is not required for logical databases.  **Note**  You can obtain the host name and port number from the details page of the tenant in which the target database is located, such as a tenant created on Alibaba Cloud or in OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
   | Default Database        | When you connect to a database in a MySQL tenant, you must specify the default database for the connection. You do not need to specify this field when you connect to a database in an Oracle tenant.  **Note**  If you leave this parameter unspecified, the information_schema database is connected by default.  However, if the connection to the information_schema database fails, you need to specify a database that the current user has access permissions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
   | Database Account        | * Database Username: an account under the tenant. In MySQL mode, this account must have access to the default database.   * Database Password: the password of the account under the tenant. You can click **Test Connection** next to the password field to check the connection to the target database.   * Save Database Password * If you disable this option, the database password for the connection is not saved. Each time you use or test the connection, you must enter the database password in the password dialog box.   * If you enable this option, the database password for the connection is saved. You do not need to enter the database password each time you use the connection.      **Note**  * An error will be returned if the configurations such as the username, password, and network settings are invalid.   * You can only connect to a database in the current tenant. Otherwise, a test failure error will be returned.                                                                                                                                            |
   | SQL Query Timeout Value | You can specify a timeout value for SQL queries. A query whose execution time exceeds the timeout value is automatically terminated. The default timeout value is 60 seconds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
   | Query sys Tenant View   | When Database Type is set to Physical Database, you can specify an account that has the privilege to query the SYS tenant view, and the password. This field is automatically populated when SYS is specified as the tenant in **Endpoint** .  * **Account** : an account having the privilege to check the views under the SYS tenant.   * **Password** : the password of the account.    After you specify the account and password, click **Test Connection** next to the password field to verify whether the account information is valid.  **Note**  * In ODC V2.3.0 and later versions, to use the import and export features, you need to configure the root@sys account in the Advanced Configuration section during connection creation.   * In ODC V2.4.1 and later versions, the dependency of the import and export features on the root@sys user is removed when you query views. If the root@sys account is not configured, some ODC objects such as stored procedures and functions do not support the export feature. If the root@sys account is configured, you can access the views under the SYS tenant to obtain the optimal data routing strategy, which can increase the export speed.    |

   

3. Click **Save** to save the current configuration in the ODC connection list. Next time you log on to ODC, you can directly select the connection from the list. The connection configuration does not necessarily need to pass the connection test when you save the configuration.

   

4. Click **Copy Connection String** in the lower part of the panel to copy the connection information being edited on the current panel as a connection string if necessary. This allows you to obtain the connection information with ease.

   

5. Click **Cancel** if you do not need to save the current connection configuration. Then, a confirmation dialog box appears.
