View connection history 
--------------------------------------------

In the upper-right corner of the **Private Connection** tab, click **History** . The **Historical Opened Windows** panel appears. 

![History](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/6366319361/p342087.png)

The panel shows a list that has the following columns.


|        Column        |                                                                              Description                                                                              |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Connection Name      | The name of the connection you accessed.                                                                                                                              |

| Recently Opened At   | The time when you last accessed the connection.                                                                                                                       |
| SQL/PL Window        | The workspace window that you created when you accessed the connection. Move the pointer to a window name, and the script that you edited in the window is displayed. |
| Actions              | You can click **Open** to resume the connection in a new window. The corresponding workspace window and its content are also resumed.                                 |


**Note**



By default, the historical records in the panel are saved for 48 hours. You can quickly restore the content in an unsaved SQL window based on records in the panel.

Set a tag 
------------------------------

ODC allows you to create a tag and assign it to a connection. You can assign only one tag to each connection. Alternatively, you can move the pointer in the tag column of the row where the target connection is located in the connection list and click **Set Tag** . The drop-down list provides options for you to create, set, and manage tags. 

* Tag creation: You can create a tag by using the following two methods:

  * Click **Set Tag** next to the **Connection Name** field in the **Create Connection** panel.

    
  
  * Move the pointer in the tag column of the row where the target connection is located in the connection list, click **Set Tag** and click **Create Tag** in the drop-down list. On the **Tags** page, specify the name and color of the tag, and click the tick icon to complete the creation.

    
  

  

* Tag setting: Select the target tag from the drop-down list that displays all the tags that you created, and modify related parameters to finish the setting.

  

* Tag management: Click the settings icon in the upper-right corner of the drop-down list to go to the **Tags** page, In the Tags window, you can edit or delete created tags.

  




Pin a private connection to the top 
--------------------------------------------------------

By default, the connections in the connection list are sorted by their creation time, with the most recently created connection on top. The list does not support custom sorting, but you can pin frequently used connections to the top. 

You can click the flag ![Homepage - Pin Connection Name to Top](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/6818379361/p342106.png) next to the name of a connection to pin the connection to the top. This turns the flag to yellow. You can click the flag again to unpin the connection from the top.

Edit a private connection 
----------------------------------------------

Click **Edit** in the **Actions** column of the target connection. The **Edit Connection** panel appears, which has the same structure as the **Create Connection** panel and displays the configuration information of the current connection. You can edit the information displayed in the **Edit Connection** panel. 

Before you change **Database Password** , you must first click **Change Password** next to the password box. To abort the current change, click **Cancel** next to the password box, and the input in the password box is restored to its original value.

Copy a private connection 
----------------------------------------------

Click **Copy** in the **Actions** column of the target connection. The **Create Connection** panel appears. The copied information is automatically filled in the panel. This allows you to quickly create a connection by modifying existing information. 

The copy feature allows you to easily create database connections having similar information.

Delete a private connection 
------------------------------------------------

To delete a connection, click **Delete** in the **Actions** column of the target connection. 

For example, when the connected database no longer exists or you do not need to access the connected database, you can directly delete the corresponding connection.

Other operations 
-------------------------------------

In addition to the management actions that the **Private Connection** tab provides, after you go to the management page of a database connection, the homepage menu icon ![Homepage menu](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/7767860461/p352089.jpg) in the top navigation bar further provides the following buttons:

* **Open Connection in New Window** : After you click a connection in the connection list that appears, ODC opens the connection in a new window.

  

* **Connections** : Click this button to open the ODC homepage in a new window. On the ODC homepage, you can view and manage the configuration information of all connections.

  

* **Reload** : Click this button to reload the current page.

  

* **Exit Connection** : Click this button to exit the current connection and go to the ODC homepage.

  




![Image 031](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/9906118461/p232235.png)

Information such as the connection name, schema (in Oracle mode), and database name (in MySQL mode) appears in the top navigation bar of the workspace. 

* Move your pointer over the connection name in the top navigation bar. In the tooltip that appears, you can see information in the following fields: **Connection Mode** , **Host/Port** , **Cluster/Tenant** , and **Database Username** .![Manage private connections - Other operations](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/9102553561/p358120.png)

  

* Click the drop-down arrow next to the displayed schema name or database name. All the schemas and databases accessible to the current database user are included in the drop-down list that appears. You can switch to a target schema or database by clicking its name in the list.![Manage private connections - switch between connections within a connection](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/2800571561/p413596.png)
