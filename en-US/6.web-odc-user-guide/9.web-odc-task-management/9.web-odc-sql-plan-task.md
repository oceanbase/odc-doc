# SQL plan task

## Background information

OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) can periodically execute SQL scripts created by users to complete database development and O&M tasks as required by the users. For example, ODC can periodically execute stored procedures, backup, and database and table schema synchronization.

After a user creates an SQL plan task in **Task Center**, the administrator can approve the task on the Tasks page in Task Center. The user can view the task information and approval status on the Tasks page in Task Center.

This topic describes how to create and manage SQL plan tasks in ODC.
