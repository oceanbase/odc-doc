Recycle bin 
================================
#docSlug#odc-enterprise/V3.3.1/web-odc-recycle-bin
Log on to OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) and click the name of the target connection to go to the corresponding database object management page. Click **Recycle Bin** in the upper-right corner to go to the recycle bin page. 



The recycle bin temporarily stores deleted database objects and allows you to search for and restore the deleted objects. 

Technically, the recycle bin is a data dictionary table that stores the information about deleted database objects. Deletion here refers to the `DROP` operation. Data that is deleted by the `DELETE` operation will not be moved to the recycle bin. Therefore, an object deleted by the `DROP` operation is not permanently deleted and still occupies storage space. You can use the `PURGE` operation or empty the recycle bin in ODC to release the space. 

The following figure shows the recycle bin page.![Recycle bin](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/4116211561/p203469.png)

|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Original Name | The name of the deleted object specified by its creator.  You can click Original Name to sort the objects by original name in ascending or descending order. |
| Object Name   | The name that ODC gives to the object.  Unlike the original name, the object name is never repeated and can uniquely identify an object.                     |
| Object Type   | The type of the deleted object.                                                                                                                                              |
| Recycled At   | The timestamp when the object was deleted. The timestamps help you track deleted objects with ease.                                                                          |



In addition, the navigation bar on the recycle bin page provides buttons with the following features.
