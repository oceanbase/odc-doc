Task process management
===========================


Background
-------------------------

OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) allows users with special permissions, such as administrators with permissions on the public resource console, to define change task processes. Users with read-only permissions can initiate [change tasks](../../6.web-odc-user-guide/9.web-odc-task-management/1.web-odc-task-management-overview.md) based on the defined task processes.

Users with this special permission can modify, view, and disable change task processes in the public resource console. Supported task processes include data import, export, and mocking, database changes, partition plan, shadow table and connection permission application.
