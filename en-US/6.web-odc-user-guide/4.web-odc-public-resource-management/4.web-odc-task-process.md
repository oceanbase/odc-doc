Manage task processes 
==========================================



Background 
-------------------------------

OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) allows administrators with permissions on the public resource console to define change task processes. Other users with the read-only permissions can initiate [change tasks](/zh-CN/7.client-odc-user-guide/8.client-odc-task-management/1.client-odc-task-management-overview.md) based on the defined task processes. 

The administrators can modify, view, and disable change task processes in the public resource console.

Log on to ODC as the administrator, and go to the **Public Resource Console** page. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Task Process** to display the **Task Process Management** page on the right. 

The information of task processes is displayed in a list on the **Task Process Management** page. On this page, you can perform the following operations:

* Click the refresh icon to manually refresh the list.

  

* Search for task processes by using the search box in the upper-right corner of the list.

  

* Select the check box ![Check box](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/9997191561/p416674.jpg) to delete multiple task processes at a time.

  




### Task process list 

The information of task processes is provided by columns, which are described in the following table. A filter is provided on top of some columns for you to filter task processes.


|      Column       |                                                                                                                                                                                                       Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Task Process Name       | The name of a task process can contain up to 110 characters in length, and can contain digits, English letters, and Chinese characters. The names of task processes in the same organizational structure must be unique.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Task Type               | * Currently, you can customize task processes only for database changes. The task subtypes of database changes are Update, Delete, Insert, Select, Create, Drop, Alter, and Other.   * The task type defines the types of change operations supported in a task process. You cannot initiate a task process where the change operations are beyond the range defined by the task type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Risk Levels             | The default value is 1. You can modify the value as needed. The maximum value is 10. We recommend that you set this parameter to 3.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Task Approval Process   | * By default, only one risk level is set. The risk level: * Contains all task subtypes you selected.   * Does not limit the volume of data to be changed.   * Requires approval by the system administrator by default. You can customize approval nodes for the risk level by setting the number of nodes and the approval roles.     * If multiple risk levels are set, you can set **Task Subcategory** , **Number of SQL Statements Supported** , and **Set Approval Node** for each risk level separately.     |
| Process Validity Period | You can specify the validity period of approval. If the specified period expires, the approval is automatically terminated. The default value is 24 hours (1 day). You can modify the value as needed. The maximum value is 240 hours (10 days).  * Approval Validity Period: the validity period of approval. If this period expires, the task expires.   * Valid Waiting Period: the waiting period before manual execution. If this period expires, the task expires.   * Operation Validity Period: the validity period of execution. If this period expires, the task expires.    |
| Task Process Status     | You can enable or disable the task process. You cannot initiate tasks of a disabled process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
