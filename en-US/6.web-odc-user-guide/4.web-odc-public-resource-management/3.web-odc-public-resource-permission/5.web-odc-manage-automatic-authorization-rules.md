# Automatic authorization rules



## Background

OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) allows system administrators to define automatic authorization rules. System administrators can create, modify, view, and disable automatic authorization rules in the public resource console.

The automatic authorization feature automatically grants roles or permissions to users whose names, departments, or logon methods meet specific conditions when they are being created or log on for the first time, to avoid redundant authorization operations.

This topic describes how to create and manage automatic authorization rules in the public resource console.

## Create an automatic authorization rule

### Procedure

![2](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/410/Automatic%20Authorization%20Rules/2-EN.png)

1. In the upper-right corner of the **Automatic Authorization Rules** page, click **Create** **Rule**. The **Create** **Rule** panel appears.


2. Specify the following parameters in the **Create** **Rule** panel.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Rule Name | The name of the rule, which must be unique.  |
   | Status | Select **Enabled** or **Disabled**. <br>By default, the status of the rule is **Enabled**. You can set it to **Disabled** as needed. A disabled rule cannot be accessed.  |
   | Trigger Event | Select a trigger event. Only built-in events are available. Different events correspond to different trigger occasions.  |
   | Matching Condition (Optional) | Click **Add Condition** and specify the following four fields: <ul><li> **Object**: stores the trigger condition and the information required for executing the action. It can be a complex nested object such as an array, a list, or a map, or a simple object such as a string or a number.  </li><li> **Expression**: the index of the target in the object. Different types of objects use different indexing methods.  </li><li> **Operation**: the supported operation, for example, "Contain", "Match", or "Equal".  </li><li> **Value**: the target value. <blockquote>**Note**</br>If you do not specify the matching condition, the action is unconditionally executed when the selected event is triggered. </blockquote> |
   | Actions (Optional) | Select **Grant Role** and/or **Grant Connection Access** and specify the role name and/or public connection name. <blockquote>**Note**</br>If you do not specify the action, no action is executed regardless of whether the matching condition is met. </blockquote> |
   | Remarks (Optional) | The description of the rule.  |

3. After you specify the preceding parameters, click **Create** in the lower-right corner of the panel.

### Example

After you [integrate ODC in OAuth 2.0 and log on to ODC](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/enterprise-odc-doc-cn-10000000001031888), assume that the OAuth 2.0 system returns the following data structure:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "username",
  "mail": "example@email.com",
  "memberOf": {
    "department": [
      {
        "name": "deptA",
        "description": "this is a department"
      },
      {
        "name": "deptB",
        "description": "this is a department"
      }
    ],
    "extra": "some other info"
  }
}
```


You can use different expressions to obtain corresponding values from the data structure. Example:

| **Expression** | **Result** |
|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| id | 1 |
| memberOf.department\[0\].name | deptA |
| memberOf.department\[\*\].name | \["deptA", "deptB"\] |


The administrator can configure an automatic authorization rule for a user when the user logs on to ODC from OAuth 2.0 for the first time. The example in the following figure shows how to create an authorization rule named `Grant system_admin` for `deptB`. If `memberOf.department` contains any element named `deptB`, the user is granted the `system_admin` role.

On the **Automatic Authorization Rules** page, information is displayed in a list, and you can perform the following operations:

* Click the refresh icon to manually refresh the list.

* Search for rules by using the search box in the upper-right corner of the list.

* Adjust the column width of the rule list.


### Rule list

The information of rules is provided by columns, which are described in the following table. A filter is provided in the **Status** column for you to filter rules by status.

|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rule Name | The name of the rule.  |
| Created By | The name of the user who created the rule. <br>You can click the search icon ![Search](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/5526247461/p416691.jpg) to search for rules created by a specific user.  |
| Status | The current status of the rule. Valid values: **Enabled** and **Disabled**. <br>You can click the filter icon ![Filter](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/0583667361/p352180.jpg) to filter rules by status.  |
| Created At | The last time when the rule was edited. <br>You can sort rules in ascending or descending order of creation time.  |
| Actions | The actions you can take. Valid values: **View**, **Edit**, **Disable/Enable**, and **Delete**.  |


### View a rule

Click **View** in the **Actions** column of a rule to go to the **Rule Information** panel. The following information is displayed in the panel.
