Manage public connections 
==============================================



Overview 
-----------------------------

OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) allows you to create private and public connections. A private connection is created in ODC by a user who obtains the database access information that is not shared with all users for the sake of security. The administrator can create public connections in ODC, and combine multiple public connections to create resource groups. In this way, users in a resource group can use the public connections in this group. 

Log on to ODC as the administrator, and go to the **Public Resource Console** page. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Resource Permissions** \> **Public Connection** to display the **Public Connections** page.

| Endpoint                | * **Host Name** : the IP address of the server where the target database is located.   * **Port** : the port number of the server where the target database is located.   * **Cluster** : the name of the cluster where the target database is located. This parameter is not required for logical databases.   * **Tenant** : the name of the tenant in which the target database is located. This parameter is not required for logical databases.  **Note**  You can obtain the host name and port number from the details page of the tenant in which the target database is located, such as a tenant created on Alibaba Cloud or in OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP).    |
| Default Database        | When you connect to a database in a MySQL tenant, you must specify the default database for the connection. You do not need to specify this field when you connect to a database in an Oracle tenant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Read/Write Account      | Specify the **Database Username** and **Database Password** for accounts that have permissions to read and write the database. An ODC user with the read/write permissions can use this account to access OceanBase Database.  You can click **Test Connection** next to the password field to test the connection to the target database.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
