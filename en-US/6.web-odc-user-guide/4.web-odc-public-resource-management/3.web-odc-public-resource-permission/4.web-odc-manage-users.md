![Image 867](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/0113133561/p308934.png)

You can create users and manage user permissions on the User Management page of OceanBase Developer Center (ODC). 

Log on to ODC as the administrator, and go to the **Public Resource Console** page. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Resource Permissions** \> **User** to display the **User Management** page on the right.

Built-in user 
----------------------------------

ODC has a built-in account **admin** that is automatically assigned the administrator role **system_admin** . The administrator account has all system permissions and has access to all public resources. You cannot edit, delete, or disable the account.

Create a user 
----------------------------------

Click **Create User** in the upper-right corner of the **User Management** page. The **Create User** panel appears.

You can take the following steps to create a user:

1. Specify the **User Information** . 

   a. User information consists of the following three parts:

      * **Account** : the account used to log on to ODC. You must specify a unique account of 4 to 48 characters in length using letters, digits, and special characters. Special characters are . _ + @ # $ %

        
      
      * **Name** : the screen name to be displayed after the user logs on to ODC. The name must be specified and cannot exceed 110 characters in length.

        
      
      * **Password** : the password used to log on to ODC. The password must be specified. It must be 8 to 32 characters in length and contain at least two digits, two uppercase letters, two lowercase letters, and two special characters. Special characters are . _ + @ # $ % You can also click **Random Password** next to the field to generate a random password. 

        **Note**

        

        You will be prompted to change the user password when you log on to ODC as a new user or after the administrator changes the user password. This hardens password security and prevents password leakage.
        
      

      
   
   b. ODC allows you to create multiple users at a time. Click **Add User** to specify the information for multiple users.

      
   

   

2. Specify the **Account Status** . 

   By default, the new user is created in the **Enabled** status. You can manually disable it. A disabled account is unable to log on.
   

3. Assign roles to the new user. 

   The roles are optional and you can assign multiple roles to a user. Click the field. In the drop-down list, select the roles that you want to assign to all users you just added. If no role is available, go to the Create Role page to create one.
   

4. Specify the **Remarks** (optional). 

   Enter the description in the field. The remarks are optional and cannot exceed 140 characters in length.
   

5. Submit user information. 

   In the lower-right corner of the panel, click **Create** to submit user information.
   

6. Save user information. 

   In the **User Created** dialog box appears after you click Create, you can view the information of all users you just created. In the dialog box, you can click **Copy User Information** and **Download User Information** to save the information of multiple users in local storage. 

   This operation helps you quickly save user information when you create multiple users at a time.
