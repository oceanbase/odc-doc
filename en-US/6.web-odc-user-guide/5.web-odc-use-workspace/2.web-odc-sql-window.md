| Auto-complete                                         | The SQL editing area provides the auto-complete feature to improve your SQL statement editing efficiency.  For example, when you edit SQL statements, the table name is auto-completed for cross-database queries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

**Note**



* In ODC, multiple identical connections share one single session. The auto-commit feature of ODC in Oracle mode is enabled by default. If you want to manually commit transactions, you can choose **Settings \> Session Variable** in the SQL window or go to the **Session Properties** page to modify the value of the `autocommit` variable. For more information, see [Session management](../../7.client-odc-user-guide/9.client-odc-session-management.md).

  

* In manual-commit mode, make sure to set `ob_trx_idle_timeout` to a value greater than the timeout value of SQL queries. Otherwise, if two SQL statements in one transaction are executed at an interval longer than the value of `ob_trx_idle_timeout`, the connection will be terminated. However, if the `ob_trx_idle_timeout` parameter is set to an excessively large value, the session cannot be released in time, resulting in unnecessary memory consumption. Therefore, you must set this parameter to a proper value.

Execute a PL statement 
-------------------------------------------

You can edit a PL statement in the SQL window. Note that you must end the PL statement with the specified delimiter. 

At present, you can use the following methods to specify a delimiter in ODC:

* Click **Settings** in the toolbar of the SQL editing area. In the window that appears, select the required delimiter in the **Delimiter** field.

  

* On the **Personal Settings** page, select a required delimiter in **Delimiter Settings** . 

  **Notice**

  
  * In ODC V2.4.1 and later versions, you can use the `DELIMITER` statement in the editing area to define a delimiter. In **Settings** , the **Delimiter** field displays the delimiter that you specified.

    
  
  * You can directly use forward slashes (/) to separate PL statements.

    
  

  
  




After you execute the PL statement in the SQL window, the result tab displays the database management system (DBMS) output.

In this way, when you execute a new query, a new result tab appears but does not overwrite the pinned result tab. This allows you to compare the query results.  Click **Unpin** to unpin a result tab.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Filter, sort, and search for data        | Each field name in the result set is provided with a filter icon, a sort icon, and a search icon. You can use them to filter, sort, and search for data in a single column.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Drag the column name                     | You can adjust the order of fields by dragging column names in a result set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Edit           | Click **Edit** to enable editing mode for the current result set. The editing mode supports the following operations: **Add** , **Copy Current Row** , **Delete** , **Cancel** , **Confirm Modification** , which commits a transaction when auto-commit is enabled, and **Modify and Submit** , which is displayed when auto-commit is disabled. In the editing mode, you can either double-click target data to directly modify it or click the preceding buttons for convenient operations.  When you edit a cell, you can right-click the cell and choose **Copy** or **Set to Null** from the context menu to operate on the cell.  **Note**  The ResultMetaData is obtained during the execution of an SQL statement to indicate whether the result set can be edited. * If the result set cannot be edited, the Edit button is hidden and a prompt is displayed indicating that the result set cannot be edited.   * If the result set can be edited, the Edit button is available and you can click it to go to the result set editing page. You can edit result sets in single-table and single-view queries.   * However, result sets that involve the SET and ENUM fields cannot be edited.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Export         | You can export query results to files in the CSV or SQL format. * To export an SQL file, specify the **File Name** , **File Format** , **Encoding Standard** , and **Row Number Limit** of the file. The file encoding format can be **GBK** or **UTF8** .   * To export a CSV file, specify the **File Name** , **File Format** , **Encoding Standard** , **Row Number Limit** , and **CSV Settings** of the file.
