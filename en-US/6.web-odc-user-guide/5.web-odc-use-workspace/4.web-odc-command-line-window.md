Command-line window 
========================================

OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) integrates the OceanBase command-line client OBClient in the form of a command-line window. OBClient is the recommended command-line client for OceanBase. The command-line window allows you to use OBClient without a need to download or install it. It allows you to execute SQL or PL statements and view the execution results in real time. It also allows you to run the `SOURCE` command to execute files uploaded to the server. 

Create a command-line window 
-------------------------------------------------

Log on to ODC and click the name of the target connection to go to the corresponding connection management page. Click **Workspace** in the navigation bar on the top of the page and select **Command-line Window** from the drop-down list, to create a command-line window. The window that opens automatically connects to the current instance, and displays a default code segment that contains the connection ID, version information, and help information. 
**Notice**



You can create up to three command-line windows at a time.

If a command-line window is disconnected, the **Reconnect** button appears in the upper-right corner of the command-line window. Click the button to reconnect the window.![Image 511](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/6199620261/p267517.png)

Script management 
--------------------------------------

If you need to reference a script in your development work, you can the **Script Management** feature of the **Command-line Window** to import the script and then reference it. 

To reference a script, perform the following steps:

1. Enter Script Management panel. 

   Click the **Script Management** button in the upper-right corner of the command-line window to open the **Script Management** panel.
   

2. Import the script that you want to reference. 

   Click the file pool under **Import Script** to start the file explorer, and select the script that you want to reference. Alternatively, you can directly drag the script file into the file pool to upload it. The maximum file size supported is 250 MB.
   

3. Obtain the file path. 

   After the script is uploaded, you can view information about the script in the **Scripts** table in the panel. The table contains the following columns: **Script Path** , **Script Name** , **File Size** , and **Uploaded At** . To reference a script, click the **Copy Path** button in the Actions column and paste the path in the command-line window.
   

4. Delete a script file. 

   You can view only script files uploaded by yourself. A file will be automatically deleted 30 minutes later after it is uploaded, to avoid unnecessary space consumption. You can also click the **Delete** button in the Actions column to delete a file.
