Public Resource console
----------------------------

As a database development platform for enterprises, ODC provides the public resource console for the ODC administrator to manage users, grant permissions, and allocate resources.
> **Notice**  
> The **Public Resource Console** tab is displayed on the ODC homepage only when you log on as an administrator.

On the **Public Resource Console** tab, click **Try Now** to go to the **Public Resource Management** page.

The console enables the ODC administrator to manage users, roles, public connections, resource groups, and system settings.

You can grant users the permissions to use public and individual resources by roles. You can also use a resource group to batch grant or revoke the permissions for multiple public connections. For more information, see [Manage public resources](4.web-odc-public-resource-management/1.web-odc-public-resource-overview.md).
