Public resource console

As a database development platform for enterprises, ODC provides the public resource console for the ODC administrator to manage users, grant permissions, and allocate resources.
> **Notice**  
> The **Public Resource Console** tab is displayed on the ODC homepage only when you log on as an administrator.

On the ODC homepage, click **Console** in the left-side navigation pane to go to the public resource management page.

The console allows you to manage users, roles, public connections, resource groups, automatic authorization rules, task processes, desensitization rules, and system settings.

You can grant users the permissions to use public and private resources by roles. You can also use a resource group to batch grant or revoke the permissions for multiple public connections.
