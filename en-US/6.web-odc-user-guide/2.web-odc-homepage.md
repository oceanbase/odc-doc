Manage database connections 
------------------------------------------------

The ODC homepage provides the **Private Connection** tab that shows the connections you have created, and the **Public Connection** tab that shows the public connections that you have the permission to access. 

* On the Private Connection tab, you can click **All Modes** to filter connections to the databases in MySQL or Oracle mode. For more information, see [Manage private connections](3.web-odc-connect-database/2.web-odc-manage-connections.md).

  

* On the Public Connection tab, you can click **All Modes** to filter connections to the databases in MySQL or Oracle mode, and click **All Permissions** to filter the read-only or read/write permissions. You can click **Try Now** to go to the public resource management page. For more information, see [Manage public connections](4.web-odc-public-resource-management/3.web-odc-public-resource-permission/1.web-odc-manage-public-connection.md).

  




Public resource console 
--------------------------------------------

As a database development platform for enterprises, ODC provides the public resource console for the ODC administrator to manage users, grant permissions, and allocate resources. 
**Notice**



You can view the **Public Resource Console** tab only when you log on to the ODC homepage as an administrator.

On the **Public Resource Console** tab, you can click **Try Now** to go to the public resource management page. 

The console enables the ODC administrator to manage users, roles, public connections, resource groups, and system settings. 

You can grant users the permissions to use public and individual resources by roles. You can also use a resource group to batch grant or revoke the permissions for multiple public connections. For more information, see [Manage public resources](4.web-odc-public-resource-management/1.web-odc-public-resource-overview.md).

Language switching 
---------------------------------------

You can find the display language of ODC in the upper-right corner of the ODC logon page and ODC homepage. The default language is Simplified Chinese. You can click the language key to switch to another display language. ODC supports English, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese.

Personal settings 
--------------------------------------

The logged-on username is displayed in the upper-right corner of the top navigation bar. Click the username and select **Personal Settings** from the drop-down list that appears. The **Edit Personal Settings** panel appears. 

In the panel, you can globally modify the settings of the customizable features. You can also select a connection and configure these features in the connection. The configurations take effect on the current connection. The priority of personal settings is lower than that of settings you configured for each connection. In addition, the personal settings are persisted.
