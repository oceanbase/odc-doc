Log on to ODC with an account 
==================================================

During logon to OceanBase Developer Center (ODC), a user is identified by a logon account. The account is needed for subsequent operations such as configuring database connections and saving SQL scripts in the workspace. 


After Web ODC is deployed, you can access Web ODC through the access address of Web ODC.

## Steps

1. In the [Chrome browser of version 76 and above](../../3.odc-overview/5.product-limits.md), enter the access address of the Web ODC and press Enter.

   <main id="notice" type='notice'>
   <h4>Note</h4>
   <ul>
   <li>After ODC is deployed, you can use the IP address and port number, for example, http://IP:PORT or http://DOMAIN:PORT, of the host (where the NGINX proxy resides) to access Web ODC in a browser.</li>
   <li>The default username and password can be obtained from the administrator.</li>
   <li>When you upgrade ODC to V3.2.0 or later and encounter user conflicts, you need to manually modify the original username. For more information, see FAQs > Web ODC startup.</li>
   </ul>
   </main> 

   When you deploy Web ODC, the CAS OAuth2 protocol has been connected to realize single sign-on, and a third-party logon button will be displayed on the login page. You can click **Third Party Login** to jump to the authorization page to go to the ODC home page without using a user name and password.

2. After logging on to ODC and the connections page automatically appears on the homepage, the current account is displayed in **Me** in the lower-left corner of the navigation bar. You can click **Exit** from the drop-down list to return to the logon page. Then, you can log on to ODC with another account..
