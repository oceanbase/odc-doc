Manage roles 
=================================
#docslug#/oceanbase-developer-center/odc/V3.2.2/roles
A role is an object that holds user permissions, and users of the same role have the same permissions. OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) allows you to grant permissions to customized roles and assign the roles to users. 

Log on to ODC as the administrator, and go to the **Public Resource Console** , and choose **Member Management** in the left-side navigation pane. In the list that appears, click **Role Management** . The **Role Management** page appears.

Built-in roles 
-----------------------------------

ODC has a built-in administrator role **system_admin** that is automatically assigned to the administrator, whose username is **admin** . The administrator role has all system permissions and has access to all public and private resources. You cannot edit, delete, or disable the administrator role.

Create a role 
----------------------------------

Click **Create Role** in the upper-right corner of the **Role Management** page. The **Create Role** panel appears.![Image 883](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/6400179361/p312706.png)

To create a role, perform the following steps:

1. Specify the **Role Name** . 

   The role name must be specified and must be 1 to 48 characters in length.
   

2. Specify the **Role Status** . 

   By default, the new role is created in the **Enabled** status. You can manually disable it. The permissions for a disabled role do not take effect.
   

3. Specify the **Permission Type** . 

   You must specify at least one permission type for the role. 

   ODC allows you to specify **Public Resource Permissions** and **Individual Resource Permissions** . After you select the permission type, the **Permission Settings** section appears below it.
   

4. Configure **Permission Settings** **.** 

   The following table shows options in each **Permission Type** tab in the **Permission Settings** section.
