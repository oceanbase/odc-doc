Features of the public resource console 
------------------------------------------------------------

The public resource console of ODC manages resource permissions of users and standardizes the process of configuring risk tasks to ensure the security of data resources. 

* Resource permission management: grants the read/write permissions on public connections and resource groups to users with different roles, to allocate and control database resource permissions.

  

* Task process management: restricts the content of changes that you can initiate and provides different approval processes based on the task type, to ensure the security of database changes.

  

* Security audit management: supports 14 types of audit events such as personal settings, password management, connection management, and database operations, to ensure security compliance and allow you to trace critical events and download audit reports.

  




Resource Permission Management 
---------------------------------------------------

1. Add public connection resources. 

   As the administrator, you can create or edit a public connection resource shared by multiple users.
   

2. Configure a resource group. 

   A resource group consists of multiple public connections. It allows you to grant the permissions on multiple public connection resources to a role at a time.
   

3. Manage the permissions of a role. 

   You can grant the permissions on multiple public connection resources and individual resources to the role.
   

4. Create a user. 

   Specify the username and password of the user, and assign a role to the user to grant it the permissions on required connection resources.
