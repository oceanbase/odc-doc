Data desensitization management
=======================

**Prerequisites**
-------------------------

You are granted the administrator role of the public resource console.

**Overview**
-----------------------

Data desensitization deforms sensitive privacy information, such as names, ID card numbers, mobile phone numbers, landline numbers, bank accounts, and email addresses. You can set data desensitization rules to protect sensitive privacy data.

This topic describes how to create and manage data desensitization rules in the public resource console in OceanBase Developer Center (ODC), and how to enable data desensitization strategies in ODC scenarios such as data export and result set export.

**Scenarios**
-------------------------

ODC allows you to enable data desensitization strategies in operations such as data export and result set export.

### **Scenario 1: Enable data desensitization when you export data**

To enable a data desensitization strategy when you export the department table in ODC, perform the following steps:

1. In the table list, right-click the department table and select **Export** from the context menu.

### **Scenario 2: Enable data desensitization when you export a result set**

For more information about data exporting scenarios, see [Batch export and import](../6.web-odc-use-tools/1.web-odc-data-export-and-import/3.web-odc-batch-export-and-import.md). To enable a data desensitization strategy when you download the result set returned by querying the department table in ODC, perform the following steps:

1. In the result set, click the **Download Data** icon. In the **Download Data** panel, click **Data Desensitization** and select a data desensitization strategy.
