View operation records 
===========================================

This topic describes how to view the history of operation events in OceanBase Developer Center (ODC). 

Background 
-------------------------------

You can view operation records in ODC for the following purposes:

* Security compliance: A variety of features provided by operation records help you make sure that operations in your system meet security and compliance requirements.

  

* Real-time monitoring: You can monitor business operations related to public connections in real time through operation records.

  

* Event tracing: Database behaviors can be periodically compared based on operation records, which helps you locate anomaly points and abnormal behaviors in the database and allows you to trace risks. Besides, with operation records, correlated queries and analysis can be performed based on the database access source, to help you find the exact operator who accesses the database.

  




Operation record list 
------------------------------------------

**Note**



You can view your own operation records in this list. 

Operation records are retained permanently.
