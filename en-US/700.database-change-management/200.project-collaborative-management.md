# Project collaboration management

## Background information

Web OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) V4.2.0 allows a user with the project creation permission to create a project and add members to the project. A project member can add and change databases in the project.

This topic describes how to implement database changes through project collaboration.

## Technical mechanism

![1](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/420/700.database-change-management/200.project-collaborative-management/2EN.png)

1. The ODC system administrator grants the project creation permission to a user. Then, the user can create a project and adds members to the project.

2. The project administrator or DBA adds a database to the project.

3. A project member initiates a database change ticket.

4. ODC determines the risk level of this ticket based on the risk level identification rules and selects the corresponding approval process for this ticket.

5. After the ticket is approved, the database change is automatically executed by ODC or manually executed by the user.

## Project creation

### Method 1: A user with the project creation permission creates a project

1. The system administrator grants the project creation permission to a user.

   ![2](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/424/700.database-change-management/200.project-collaborative-management/2EN.png)

2. The project administrator creates a project and adds members to the project.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p>An ODC user with the project creation permission can create projects. By default, the user who creates a project is granted the administrator role of this project. After the project administrator assigns ODC users as members of the project, the members can access this project after logging on to the ODC console with their own accounts, and work as a team in the project. </p>
   </main>

   | DBA | A user that manages all databases of the project.  |
   | Developer | A user that can log on to all databases, execute SQL statements, and submit tickets, which is usually a developer.  |
   | Security Administrator (Optional) | A user that can manage only sensitive columns of the project and participate in review.  |
   | Participant (Optional) | A user that can participate only in review.  |
   | Description (Optional) | The description of the project.  |

### Method 2: Join a project

An ODC user can apply for project permissions to join an existing project.

1. On the **Projects** or **Tickets** tab, click the corresponding button to apply for project permissions.

   a. Apply for permissions on the **Projects** tab.

## Database management

### Method 1: A user with database permissions adds a database

1. Click the name of a project to go to the project management page.

   ![4](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/430/700.database-change-management/200.project-collaborative-management/4EN.png)

2. Add a database.

   ![5](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/430/700.database-change-management/200.project-collaborative-management/5EN.png)

3. A member can export data, import data, perform database changes, and log on to databases. The project administrator or DBA can set a database administrator and change the project to which a member belongs.

   ![6.0](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/430/700.database-change-management/200.project-collaborative-management/6EN.png)

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
     <h4>Note</h4>
     <p>If a data source has been bound to a project, you cannot transfer the databases in the data source to other projects. </p>
   </main>

### Method 2: Apply for database permissions

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>To apply for database permissions, make sure that you have joined the corresponding project. </li>
  <li>You can apply for permissions on databases only in the project that you have joined. </li>
  </ul>
</main>

You can apply for the query, export, and change permissions on databases.

1. On the **Projects** or **Tickets** tab, click the corresponding button to apply for database permissions.

   a. Apply for permissions on the **Projects** tab.

## Ticket management

A project member without the database editing permission can submit a ticket to execute a data export, data import, data mocking, database change, lock-free schema change, SQL plan, or data archiving task.

## Member management

The project administrator can add, edit, or remove members as well as manage database permissions on the **Members** tab.

## Message notification

A project member can specify the ticket events for which notifications are sent and add notification channels such as DingTalk, Feishu, WeCom, and custom webhooks on the **Notification** tab. When the corresponding ticket event occurs, ODC will send a change message to notify the project member. For more information, see [Message notification management](1000.message-notification.md).
