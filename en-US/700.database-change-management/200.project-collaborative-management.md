# Project collaboration management

## Background information

Web OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) V4.2.0 allows a user with the project creation permission to create a project and add members to the project. A project member can add and change databases in the project.

This topic describes how to implement database changes through project collaboration.

## Technical mechanism

![1](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/420/700.database-change-management/200.project-collaborative-management/2EN.png)

1. The ODC system administrator grants the project creation permission to a user. Then, the user can create a project and adds members to the project.

2. The project administrator or DBA adds a database to the project.

3. A project member initiates a database change ticket.

4. ODC determines the risk level of this ticket based on the risk level identification rules and selects the corresponding approval process for this ticket.

5. After the ticket is approved, the database change is automatically executed by ODC or manually executed by the user.

## Project creation

### Method 1: A user with the project creation permission creates a project

1. The system administrator grants the project creation permission to a user.

   ![2](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/423/700.database-change-management/200.project-collaborative-management/2EN.png)

2. The project administrator creates a project and adds members to the project.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p>An ODC user with the project creation permission can create projects. By default, the user who creates a project is granted the administrator role of this project. After the project administrator assigns ODC users as members of the project, the members can access this project after logging on to the ODC console with their own accounts, and work as a team in the project. </p>
   </main>

     <h4>Note</h4>
     <p>If a data source has been bound to a project, you cannot transfer the databases in the data source to other projects. </p>
   </main>

## Ticket management

A project member without the database editing permission can submit a ticket to execute a data export, data import, data mocking, database change, lock-free schema change, SQL plan, or data archiving task.
