# Collaborative project management

This topic introduces how to implement database changes in project collaboration.

## Background information

Web ODC V4.2.0 allows users who have the project creation permission to create projects and add project members. Project members can add and change databases in their projects.

## Principle

![1](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/420/700.database-change-management/200.project-collaborative-management/2EN.png)

1. The ODC system administrator grants a user the project creation role. The user creates a project and adds project members.

2. The project administrator or DBA member adds a database.

3. A project member initiates a ticket to apply for database changes.

4. ODC checks the risk level of the ticket based on the risk level identification rules and executes the review process based on the risk level.

5. After the ticket is approved, ODC automatically executes the database change or a user manually executes the database change.

## Create a project

1. The system administrator grants the project creation permission to a user.

2. The project administrator creates a project and adds project members.

      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p>ODC users with the project creation permission can create projects. By default, the project creator is granted the project administrator role. After the project administrator adds ODC users to a project as project members, the project members can access the project and perform team collaboration for the project after they log on to ODC. </p>
   </main>

## Manage databases

1. Click the project name to go to the **Project Management** page.


2. Add a database on the **Databases** page.


3. A project member can export data from, import data to, change, and log on to the database, and transfer the database to another project.


## Manage tickets

A project member without the database edit permission can submit tickets to apply for data export, data import, data simulation, database change, lock-free schema change, SQL plan, and data archiving operations.


## Manage members

A project administrator can add, edit, and remove project members on the **Members** page.


## Set projects

The project administrator can modify the project name and archive projects on the **Settings** page.
