# SQL check specifications

This topic introduces how to edit and execute SQL check specifications.

## Background information

After the system administrator grants development specification operation permissions to a user, the user can manage SQL check specifications on the **Environment** tab of **Security Specifications**.

When a user executes an SQL statement in the SQL window, create a database change, or create a table, ODC checks the SQL statement based on the configured SQL check specifications.


## Concepts

- Rule level: the level of an SQL review rule. Rule levels can be divided into the following three categories:

   - Compliance: The matching SQL statements are compliant and do not need to be improved.

   - Improvement recommended: The matching SQL statements have a non-serious issue that can be rectified or ignored. Usually, a prompt is thrown for these statements.

   - Improvement required: The matching SQL statements have a serious issue that must be rectified. If the SQL statement is not rectified, data or business security will be affected. The SQL statement must be rectified before being executed.

- Rule status: the status of an SQL review rule. If a rule is enabled, ODC check the tickets initiated by users and SQL statements to be executed against the rule. If a rule is disabled, it is ignored.

- Rule type: the type of database object to which the rule applies. Rule types can be divided into the following categories:

   - TABLE: a table object.

   - SELECT: a query statement.

   - INSERT: an insert statement.

   - UPDATE: an update statement.

   - DELETE: a delete statement.

   - DDL: a DDL statement.

   - DML: a DML statement.

   - DQL: a DQL statement.

   - INDEX: an INDEX creation statement.

## Execution process

![2.2](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/420/700.database-change-management/400.sql-check-specification/2.2EN.png)

1. A user with the development specifications operation permission edits and enables SQL check specifications in the environment.

2. An ODC user executes an SQL statement in the command-line window, in the anonymous block window, or for a database change. The SQL specification check is initiated.

3. SQL statements that meet the SQL specifications are executed, and others are blocked.

## Prerequisites

You have the development specifications operation permission.

## Procedure

Assume that you want to edit and enable the rule named **Columns must be commented** in the test environment of SQL check specifications. Edit and execute the `CREATE TABLE` statement.

| Parameter | Example |
| -------- | -------- |
| Project Name | odc_4.2.0 |
| Data Source | mysql_4.2.0 |
| Database Name | odc_test |
| Table Name | employee |

1. Log on to web ODC. In the project collaboration window, choose **Security Specifications** > **Environment** > **sit** > **SQL check specification**.



2. As shown in the preceding figure, on the **SQL check specification** tab, edit the rule named **Columns must be commented**.

3. Click **OK**.


4. On the **SQL check specification** tab, enable **Columns must be commented**.


5. In the project collaboration window, choose **Projects** > **All Projects** > **odc_4.2.0**.


6. Click **Database** to log on to the database and go to the SQL development window.


7. In the SQL window, edit the SQL statement to create the table named `employee`, and click **Press F8** to run all the SQL statements in the current SQL window.


   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE `odc_test`.`employee` (
   `emp_no` int(120) NULL,
   `birthday` date NULL,
   `name` varchar(120) NULL
   ) DEFAULT CHARSET = utf8mb4 COLLATE = utf8mb4_general_ci ;
   ```

8. As shown in the preceding figure, the **No column comment** message is printed in the log.
