# Change lock-free structures

This topic introduces how to submit a lock-free change ticket to implement lock-free structure changes to a database.

## Background information

ODC V4.2.0 provides the lock-free structure change feature to solve the table locking issue when you change the structure of a database table.

The following table describes the online structure changes that ODC supports by the database version.

| Version | Supported change types |
| ------ | ------ |
| Versions earlier than OceanBase Database V4.0.0 | <ul><li>    Modifying column properties, including the column type, default value, and non-null constraints </li><li>  Deleting columns. Deletion of primary key columns or columns that contain indexes is not supported. </li><li>   Adding a unique index to a non-partition table </li><li> Adding or deleting foreign keys  </li></ul> |
| OceanBase Database V4.0.0 and later | <ul><li>  Changing a column to an auto-increment one </li><li>Changing the type or length requirements </li><li>  Adding and modifying a primary key </li></ul> |

## Prerequisites

- In MySQL mode of OceanBase Database, a table name cannot exceed 56 characters. In Oracle mode, a table name cannot exceed 120 characters.

- A table must contain a primary key or a unique key.

## Considerations

- When the destination table contains a primary key or unique key, in a lock-free structure change, the primary key or unique key is used for table segmentation in a full table copy and subsequent incremental updates.

- Ensure that the database disk space is sufficient.

- When you perform other DDL operations on a table during the execution of a lock-free schema change on the same table, the task fails.

## Principle

1. Create a temporary table.

2. Change the structure of the temporary table.

3. Copy full data of the table.

4. Synchronize incremental data.

5. Verify data consistency.

6. Kill the session.

7. Switch between the old and new tables.


## Execution process

![2](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/420/700.database-change-management/700.table-structure-change/2EN.png)

1. A user initiates a lock-free structure change task.

2. ODC performs a precheck on the SQL statement entered by the user.

3. Roles on the approval nodes approve the task.

4. ODC executes the lock-free structure change task.

## Procedure

Assume that you want to change the type of the `birth` column in the `student` table to `datetime`.

| Parameter | Example |
| ------ | ------ |
| Project Name | osc |
| Data Source | test137yaobinobmysql |
| Database Name | osc_test |
| Table Name | student |

1. In the SQL window, edit the SQL statement to create a table named `student` in the `osc_test` database.



2. On the **Tasks** tab, choose **Lock-free Schema Change** > **Create Lock-free Schema Change**.


3. In the **Create Lock-free Schema Change** dialog box, specify the following parameters.


   | Parameter | Description |
   |--------|-------|
   | Database | The database to be changed.  |
   | Change Definitions | <ul><li>CREATE TABLE: The `CREATE` statement is required for syntax that is not supported by OceanBase Database. </li><li>ALTER TABLE: In OceanBase Database V4.0.0 and later, you can use the ALTER statement in ALTER TABLE OFFLINE mode. </li></ul> |
   | SQL Content | Enter the SQL script in the editing area.  |
   | Table Switch Settings | The original table is replaced by the destination table after the data is consistent. <ul><li>Table Lock Timeout: The table is locked during the table switching process. If the table is not switched within the timeout period, the execution may fail. </li><li>Number of Retries: the number of retries to be automatically performed if the table is not switched within the timeout period. </li><li>Source Table Clearing Policy: Select **Ignore** to rename and retain the original table, or select **Delete Now** to delete the original table after the lock-free structure change is completed. </li></ul> |
   | Task Settings | <ul><li> Select **Execute immediately** or **Timed execution** to set the task execution mode. </li><li>The lock-free structure change tool provides two methods to handle task errors:<ul><li> **Abort Task**: This is the default option. When you select this option, the task is aborted if an error occurs when you run the script. </li><li> **Ignore Error and Continue**: When you select this option, the system skips the statement where an error occurs and continues to execute other statements in the script. </li></ul></li></ul> |
   | Remarks | The description of the change. The description can contain up to 200 characters. This parameter is optional.  |
3. Click **Create** to create the lock-free structure change.

4. After the task is generated, you can view the task information in the **Lock-free Structure Change** list on the **Tasks** page.



## View lock-free structure change tasks

### Task information

1. In the lock-free structure change list on the **Task Center** page, click **View** in the **Actions** column.

2. In the **Task Details** panel, click the **Task Information** tab to view the database, task type, risk level, SQL content, and rollback content.


3. You can click **Initiate Again** to re-initiate the lock-free structure change task.

### Task process


In the **Task Details** panel, click the **Task Process** tab to view the task status, approval status, execution status, and execution result of the task.


### Execution records


In the **Task Details** panel, click the **Execution Records** tab to view the DDL statements of the new and original tables.

### Task logs



In the **Task Details** panel, click the **Task Logs** tab to view all task logs and alert logs.


| Parameter | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| All Logs | Displays the complete information of all task logs, including **INFO**, **ERROR**, and **WARN** logs.  You can click **Find**, **Download**, or **Copy** to search for, download, or copy all logs.  |
| Alert Logs | Displays the **ERROR** and **WARN** logs of the task. When a task fails, you can view the error message in the alert logs.  You can click **Find**, **Download**, or **Copy** to search for, download, or copy alert logs.  |
