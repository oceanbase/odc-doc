# Risk levels, risk identification rules, and approval processes

This topic introduces how to manage risk levels, risk identification rules, and approval processes.

## Background information

- Risk level: the risk level of a ticket, which determines the approval process of a ticket.

- Risk identification rule: a rule that determines the risk level of a ticket.

- Approval process: a change task process defined by the ODC system administrator.

## Principle

1. The ODC system administrator selects the approval nodes and the validity period when creating an approval process.

2. The ODC system administrator configures approval processes for each risk level (high, medium, and low).

3. The ODC system administrator configures risk identification rules for each risk level (high, medium, and low).

4. When an ODC user initiates a task ticket, ODC determines the risk level based on the risk identification rules.

5. ODC calls the corresponding approval process based on the risk level.

6. The approval role on the approval node approves or rejects the task ticket.

## Prerequisites

You have the system administrator role.

## Approval process management

1. In the project collaboration window, choose **Security Specifications** > **Risk Level**. Then choose the target risk level and click **Edit** next to the approval process.

2. In the **Select Approval Process** drop-down list of the pop-up dialog box, click **Manage approval process**.

3. In the **Manage approval process** window, click **New Approval Process**.
