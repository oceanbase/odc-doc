# Users and roles

This topic introduces how to create and manage ODC users and roles.

## Background information

OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) allows users with the user creation permission to add users and grant permissions by using roles. The added users can log on to ODC by using their accounts and passwords.

A role is an object that holds user permissions, and users of the same role have the same permissions. ODC allows you to grant permissions to customized roles and assign the roles to users.


## Principle

In ODC, users, roles, projects, and system permissions are in the following relationships:

![1.20](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/420/700.database-change-management/100.user-permission-and-management/100.odc-users-and-roles/1EN.png)

1. A user who has the user creation permission can create roles in **User Permissions**.

2. A user who has the user creation permission can add users and grant role permissions to them in **User Permissions**.

3. A user who has the review process operation permission add project roles to review nodes when creating review processes in **Security Specifications**.

4. A user who has the risk level operation permission can select a review process when editing risk levels in **Security Specifications**.

5. A user who has the risk identification permission can configure risk identification rules for specific risk levels in **Security Specifications**.


## Considerations

- ODC has a built-in administrator user **admin**. This user automatically has the administrator role **system_admin**. The administrator role has all system permissions and has access to all public and individual resources. You cannot edit, delete, or disable the administrator role.

- A role is an object that holds user permissions, and users of the same role have the same permissions. ODC allows you to grant permissions to customized roles and assign the roles to users.

## Manage users

### Create a user

#### Create a single user

Assume that you want to create a user named `ODCUSER1` in ODC and grant the `system_admin` role permission to it as the administrator.

1. Log on to web ODC. In the left-side navigation pane, click **User Permissions**.

2. On the **Users** tab of the **User Permissions** page, click **Create User**, as shown in the preceding figure.

3. On the **Create User** page, specify **User Information**.


   - User information includes the following three parts:

      | Parameter | Description |
      |-------------|--------------|
      | Account | The account used to log on to ODC. You must specify a unique account containing 4 to 48 characters in length using letters, digits, and special characters. The supported special characters are `. _ + @ # $ %`  |
      | Name | The screen name to be displayed after the user logs on to ODC. The name must be specified and cannot exceed 110 characters in length.  |
      | Password | The password used to log on to ODC. The password must be specified. It must be 8 to 32 characters in length and contain at least two digits, two uppercase letters, two lowercase letters, and two special characters. The supported special characters are `. _ + @ # $ %` <br/>You can also click **Random Password** next to the field to generate a random password. <blockquote>**Note** </br>After the administrator creates a new user or changes the password of a user, ODC prompts the user to change the user password to a complex one and protect the password against leakage when the user logs on for the first time. </blockquote> |

   - ODC allows you to create multiple users at a time. You can click **+ Add User** to specify the information for multiple users.

2. Specify **Account Status**.

   By default, the new user is created in the **Enable** status. You can manually disable it. A disabled account is unable to log on.

3. Assign roles to the new user.

   This parameter is optional. You can assign multiple roles to a user. Click the field. In the drop-down list, select the roles that you want to assign to all users you just added. If no role is available, go to the Create Role page to create one.

4. Specify **Remarks**

   This parameter is optional. Enter the description in the field. The remarks are optional and cannot exceed 140 characters in length.

5. Click **Create** to submit user information.

6. Save user information.


   In the **User Created** dialog box that appears after you click Create, you can view the information of all users you just created. In the dialog box, you can click **Copy User Information** and **Download User Information** to save the information of multiple users in local storage.

   The two operations help you quickly save user information when you create multiple users at a time.

7. View the imported user information in the **Users** list.


#### Import multiple users at a time

ODC V4.1.2 and later allow you to upload configuration files to batch import users. Perform the following steps:

1. On the **Users** tab of the **User Permissions** page, click **Batch Import**.


2. In the **Batch Import** panel, click **Download Template**, and specify the parameters of the users to be imported.
