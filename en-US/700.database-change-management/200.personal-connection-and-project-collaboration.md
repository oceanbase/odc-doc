1. The system administrator creates a project in Web OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) and assigns members to the project.

2. The system administrator or a project member with the data source creation permission creates a data source.

3. The project DBA or project owner adds a database in the data source to the project.

4. A project member creates a database change task.

5. When the project member initiates a task ticket, an approval process is automatically selected based on the risk level and identification rules.

6. The approval roles on the corresponding approval process nodes review the task process.

7. The database change task is executed after it is approved.
