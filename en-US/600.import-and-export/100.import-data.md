# Import schemas and data

## Background information

OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) allows you to import schemas and data of database objects in batches.

You can create import tasks in ODC to import both schemas and data, only data, or only schemas of database objects.

- Import schemas and data: You can import both the definition statements and data of database objects.

- Import only data: You can import only the data of table or view objects.

- Import only schemas: You can import only definition statements of database objects.

## Import formats

ODC supports importing ZIP (batch import and single-table import), SQL (batch import), and CSV (single-table import) files.

A ZIP file here is a compressed package that is suffixed with `.zip`. In the **Create Import Task** panel, select **ZIP Files** for **Import Format**, and then select **CSV Format** or **SQL Format** for **Data Format**, which specifies the data format of the package.

SQL files supported for batch data import are suffixed with `.sql` and contain statements that can be directly executed in the database. These statements include `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `CREATE`, and `DROP`.

CSV files supported for single table import are data files that are suffixed with `.csv` or `.txt`. These files support custom delimiters.

## Considerations

- The maximum size of files imported in one batch in Web ODC cannot exceed 2 GB after compression. To import data of a larger size, use the data import tool [OBLOADER](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-dumper-loader-1000000000246590).

- At most five concurrent import tasks are supported. Subsequent tasks need to wait in the queue.

- By default, files related to import tasks are retained for 14 days.

- In ODC of a version later than V4.1.0, you can configure a sys tenant account for an OceanBase data source to increase the import speed.

## Create an import task

Example: Import the schemas and data of the `employee` and `salary` tables on the local disk to the `odc_test` database.

| Parameter | Example value |
| ------ | ------ |
| Data source | mysql4.2.0 |
| Database name | odc_test |
| Table name | `employee` and `salary` |

1. On the **Ticket** tab, choose **Data Import** > **Create New**.

2. In the task panel that appears, select the format of the file to be imported.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
     <h4>Note</h4>
     <ul>
     <li>At present, ODC supports importing CSV, SQL, and ZIP files in batches. </li>
     <li>If you select <strong>CSV Files</strong> for <strong>Import Format</strong>, header fields of the first row can be skipped during the import. </li>
     <li>If you select <strong>ZIP Files</strong> for <strong>Import Format</strong>, you can import a single table or multiple tables and skip existing schemas. </li>
     </ul>
   </main>

3. Upload the file to be imported.

   Click the file pool to go to the file explorer and select the file to be imported. You can also directly drag the file to the file pool to upload it. The format of the uploaded file must be the same as the value you specified for **Import Format**. Upload a file suffixed with `.zip` if you have selected **ZIP Files** for **Import Format**, upload a file suffixed with `.sql` if you have selected **SQL Files** for **Import Format**, and upload a file suffixed with `.csv` if you have selected **CSV Files** for **Import Format**.

4. Specify **File Encoding**.

   ODC supports the following encoding standards: **ASCII**, **ISO-8859-1**, **GB2312**, **GBK**, **GB18030**, **Unicode (UTF-8)**, **Unicode (UTF-16)**, **Unicode (UTF-32)**, and **BIG5**.

5. Go to the **Import Settings** panel.

   Click **Next: Import Settings** to configure file import settings and the sys tenant account.

6. Specify **Import Content**.

   ![3](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/422/600.import-and-export/100.import-data/3EN.png)

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
     <h4>Note</h4>
     <ul>
     <li>You must specify this parameter when you select <strong>ZIP Files</strong> for <strong>Import Format</strong>. </li>
     <li>At present, ODC supports three import modes: <strong>Import Data Only</strong>, <strong>Import Schema Only</strong>, and <strong>Import Data and Schema</strong>. The Import Schema Only mode specifies to import the definition statement of the target object. </li>
     </ul>
   </main>

7. Select the database.

   Select the database to which the data object is to be imported. The name of the data source for the database to which the task belongs is also displayed.

8. Complete the settings in the **Import Data Settings** section.

   If you select **ZIP Files** for **Import Format** and **Import Data Only** or **Import Schema and Data** for **Import Content**, you must configure data import settings. You need to specify the following fields:

   * **Clear Data Before Import**: If you select this option, the original data in the destination object is cleared during data import.

   * **Batch Commit Quantity**: You can click **Advanced** next to **Import Data Settings** to specify this field. After you specify this field, a `COMMIT` statement is executed when the number of exported data rows reaches the specified quantity.

   * **Skipped Data Type** (Optional): You can specify the data types to be skipped during data import. The data types that can be skipped are different in MySQL and Oracle modes. You can select multiple data types.

9. Specify the **Import Schema Settings** field.

   You cannot specify this field if you select **Import Data Only** for **Import Content**. This field involves operations on schemas that already exist. If you select **Skip**, the system skips the schema definition statement in the file to be imported and directly imports the data. The original data in the object is retained. If you select **Replace**, the system executes the schema definition statement in the file to be imported to re-create an object and replace the original one. Data in the original object is cleared.

10. Specify the error handling method and execution mode.

   * ODC supports two error handling methods: **Abort Task** and **Ignore Error and Continue**. You need to select the handling method as required.

   * Select **Execute immediately** or **Timed execution** for **Execution mode**.

11. Complete the settings in the **sys Tenant Settings** section.

    a. Choose whether to select the **Use sys Tenant Account to Accelerate Import Task** option. If you select this option, you must also specify **Account** and **Password**.

    b. Click **Test Connection** next to the password field to verify whether the account information is correct. By default, the account for the connection settings is automatically filled in. If the connection fails, we recommend that you change the password for this import.

      <main id="notice" type='notice'>
      <h4>Notice</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>The account and password of the sys tenant are the account and password of a user in a cluster tenant. Do not enter <code>@sys#cluster</code> in the <strong>Account</strong> field. For example, you can set the account to <code>odc</code> and password to <code>*******</code>. </li>
      <li>If no account of the sys tenant is specified, the import/export will be slow.<strong></strong> </li>
      </ul>
      </main>


12. Choose whether to retain the current settings.

    You can select **Retain Current Configuration** in the lower-right corner to save the current data file and schema file settings.

13. Generate the import task.

    After you specify all preceding information, you can click **Submit** in the lower-right corner of the panel to create an import task.

14. View the import task.

    After the task is generated, the **Ticket** tab automatically appears, where you can view the task information.
