# Export schema and data

This topic provides information on exporting the schema and data of database objects.

## Background information

OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) allows you to export schemas and data of database objects in batches.

You can create an export task to export only schemas of database objects, only data of database objects, or both.

- Export both schema and data: Export both the definition statements and data of database objects.

- Export data only: Export only data of table or view objects.

- Export schema only: Export only definition statements of database objects.

## Formats of exported files

ODC exports data in a zip file, which contains the metadata file MANIFEST.bin, the schema definition files of the exported objects, and the data files.

When you create an export task, if you set **Data Format** to **SQL Format**, the zip file contains the schema definition files named in the `<object name>-schema.sql` format and data files named in the `<object name>.sql` format. The object names are the same as those of the objects in the database.

If you set **Data Format** to **CSV Format**, the zip file contains the schema definition files named in the `<object name>-schema.sql` format and data files named in the `<object name>.csv` format. The object names are the same as those of the objects in the database.

## Considerations

- In web ODC, the maximum size of files exported in one batch cannot exceed 2 GB before compression. To export data of a larger size, use [OceanBase OBDUMPER](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/enterprise/oceanbase-dumper-loader-cn/V3.2.0/10000000000610778).

- The status of a task, such as Succeeded, Failed, and Canceled, does not affect the lifecycle of the task files. Tasks are permanently retained. Task-related files are retained for 14 days by default.

- Instances earlier than OceanBase Database V2.2.30 support only UTF8.

- In ODC V2.2.1 and earlier, to use the export feature, you must connect to the target OceanBase Database instance by using ODP. ODC does not support the export feature for direct connections.

- In ODC V2.4.1 and later versions, you can configure the sys tenant account to improve the export speed. To export objects other than tables and views, you must configure the sys tenant account.

## Create an export task

Assume that you want to batch export the schemas and data of the `employee` and `salary` tables from the `odc_test` database to a local disk.

| Parameter | Example |
| ------ | ------ |
| Data Source | mysql410 |
| Database Name | odc_test |
| Table Name | employee, salary |

1. On the **Ticket** tab, choose **Export** > **Create Export Task**.


2. In the **Create Export Task** panel, select the content to be exported.


3. Select a database.

   Select the database where the object to export resides. The data source name of the target database of the task is also displayed.

   <main id="notice" type='notice'>
      <h4>Notice</h4>
      <p>OceanBase Database does not support the export feature for built-in databases in MySQL mode. </p>
   </main>

4. Select the export range.

   You can select **Partial Export** or **Full Export**.
   * If you select Partial Export, you can select the objects you want to export in the **Select Objects** pane in the **Export Objects** section. You can use the search field to search for desired objects.

   * If you select Full Export, all objects in the database are exported.

5. Go to the **Export Settings** panel.

   Click **Next: Export Settings** to specify the file export settings and the sys tenant account.

6. Configure the data files.


   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
     <h4>Note</h4>
     <p>If you set <strong>Export Content</strong> to <strong>Export Schema Only</strong>, you do not need to configure a data file. </p>
   </main>

   | **Parameter** | **Description** |
   |-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Data Format | ODC supports exporting data to files in the CSV format and SQL format. If you specify **Export Schema Only** for **Export Content**, you can only export data to files in the SQL format.  |
   | File Encoding | ODC supports the following file encodings: **ASCII**, **ISO-8859-1**, **GB2312**, **GBK**, **GB18030**, **Unicode (UTF-8)**, **Unicode (UTF-16)**, **Unicode (UTF-32)**, and **BIG5**.  |
   | Maximum Size of a Single File | If you set **Export Content** to **Export Schema Only**, you do not need to configure this parameter. <br>You can select the maximum size of a single-table data file. If the size of a file exceeds the maximum size, the file is automatically split into smaller ones for the export. If you do not specify the maximum size, the files are not split into small ones. |
   | CSV Settings | If you select the CSV format for the export and set **Export Content** to **Export Schema and Data**, you can specify the following information:<ul><li>**Include Column Header**: specifies whether to include column headers when data is exported in CSV format. This option is selected by default. </li><li>**Convert Empty Character String into Null Value**: This option is selected by default to determine whether to convert empty strings in the table to NULL values when data is exported in CSV format. </li><li>**Field Separator**: specifies the separator between fields. The following signs are supported: commas (**,**), semicolons (**;**), and colons (**:**). You can also use a character as the separator. </li><li>**Text Identifier**: specifies the identifier for the text content. Single quotation marks (**'**) and double quotation marks (**"**) are supported. </li><li>**Line Break Symbol**: specifies the line break symbol. The following characters are supported: **\\n**, **\\r**, and **\\r\\n**. </li></ul> |
   | Batch Commit Quantity (SQL Format) | When you export data in the SQL format, after you specify this field, a `COMMIT` statement is executed when the number of exported data rows reaches the specified quantity.  |
   | Use Global Snapshot | After you select this option, ODC will export the data in the globally latest snapshot for the specified table. You can select this option to ensure global data consistency.  |

7. Configure schema files.

   - If you set **Export Content** to **Export Schema Only**, you can select whether to merge the export results into one SQL file. If you select this option, the DDL statements are merged into and exported as an SQL file.

   - Choose whether to select **Add DROP TABLE Statement before CREATE TABLE Statement**. If you select this option, a `DROP` statement is added before the corresponding `CREATE` statement of an object when the schema files of the object are exported.

8. Specify the task execution method.

   Select **Execute Immediately** or **Timed Execution**.

9. Set the sys tenant account.

   1. Select **Use sys Tenant Account to Accelerate Import Task** and specify **Account** and **Password**.

   2. Click **Test Connection** next to the password field to test the connection to the target database. By default, the account for the connection settings is automatically filled in. If the connection fails, we recommend that you change the password for this export.

      <main id="notice" type='notice'>
        <h4>Notice</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>The <strong>account and password of the sys tenant</strong> are the account and password of a user in the cluster. Do not enter <code>@sys#cluster</code> in the <strong>Account</strong> field. For example, the account of the root@sys user is root. </li>
        <li>If the <strong>sys</strong> tenant account is not configured, the import and export speed may be affected. </li>
        </ul>
      </main>

10. Retain the current configuration.

      After specifying all information, select **Retain Current Configuration** in the lower-left corner of the panel to save the configuration of the current data files and schema files.

11. Generate an export task.

      After you specify all preceding information, you can click **Export** in the lower-right corner of the panel to create an export task.
