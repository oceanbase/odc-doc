# Export schemas and data

## Background information

OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) allows you to export the schemas and data of database objects in batches.

You can create an export task to export both the schemas and data, only the data, or only the schemas of database objects.

- Export schemas and data: Definition statements and data of database objects are exported.

- Export data only: Only data of table or view objects is exported.

- Export only schemas: Only definition statements of database objects are exported.

## Export format

ODC exports data in a `.zip` file, which contains the metadata file `MANIFEST.bin`, the schema definition files of the exported objects, and the data files.

When you create an export task, if you set **Data Format** to **SQL Format**, the `.zip` file contains schema definition files named in the format of `object name-schema.sql` and data files named in the format of `object name.sql`. The object names are the same as those in the database.

If you set **Data Format** to **CSV Format**, the `.zip` file contains schema definition files named in the format of `object name-schema.sql` and data files named in the format of `object name.csv`. The object names are the same as those in the database.

## Considerations

- The maximum size of data exported in one batch in ODC cannot exceed 2 GB before compression. To export data of a larger size, use the data export tool [OBDUMPER](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-dumper-loader-10000000001179957).

- At most five concurrent export tasks are supported. Subsequent tasks need to wait in the queue.

- By default, files related to export tasks are retained for 14 days.

- In ODC of a version later than V4.1.0, you can configure a sys tenant account for an OceanBase data source to increase the export speed. When you export objects other than tables and views, a sys tenant account is no longer a must.

## Create an export task

### Export schemas and data from an OceanBase database

Example: Export the schemas and data of the `employee` and `student` tables in the `odc_test` database to your local disk in batches.

| Parameter | Example value |

3. Select the database.

   Select the database where the objects to export reside. The name of the data source for the database to which the task belongs is also displayed.

   <main id="notice" type='notice'>
      <h4>Notice</h4>
      <p>In MySQL mode of OceanBase Database, export is not supported for a built-in database. </p>
   </main>

4. Select the export scope.

   You can select **Partial Export** or **Full Export**.
   * If you select **Partial Export**, you can select the objects you want to export in the **Select Objects** pane in the **Export Objects** section. You can use the search box to search for desired objects.

   * If you select **Full Export**, all objects in the database are exported.

      <main id="notice" type='explain'>
         <h4>Note</h4>
         <p>In ODC V4.2.2 and later, you can export type objects. </p>
      </main>

5. Go to the **Export Settings** panel.

   Click **Next: Export Settings** to specify the file export settings and the sys tenant account.

6. Configure data file settings.

   ![4](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/423/600.import-and-export/200.export-data/4EN.png)

    <main id="notice" type='explain'>
      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p>If you have selected <strong>Export Schema Only</strong> for <strong>Export Content</strong>, you do not need to configure data file settings. </p>
    </main>

   | **Parameter** | **Description** |
   |-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Data Format | ODC supports exporting data to files in the CSV format and SQL format. If you have selected **Export Schema Only** for **Export Content**, you can export data only to files in the SQL format.  |
   | File Encoding | ODC supports the following encoding standards: **ASCII**, **ISO-8859-1**, **GB2312**, **GBK**, **GB18030**, **Unicode (UTF-8)**, **Unicode (UTF-16)**, **Unicode (UTF-32)**, and **BIG5**.  |
   | Maximum Size of a Single File | If you have selected **Export Schema Only** for **Export Content**, you do not need to set the maximum size of a single file. <br>You can set the maximum size of a single file. When the size of a file exceeds the specified value, it is automatically split. If you set this parameter to **Unlimited**, files will not be split.  |
   | CSV Settings | If you have selected **CSV Format** for **Data Format** and **Export Schema and Data** for **Export Content**, you can set the following parameters:<ul><li>**Include the Column Header**: specifies whether to include column headers when data is exported in the CSV format. This option is selected by default. </li><li>**Convert the Empty String into a Null Value**: specifies whether to convert empty strings in the table to NULL values when data is exported in the CSV format. This option is selected by default. </li><li>**Field Separator**: specifies the separator between fields. The following signs are supported: commas (**,**), semicolons (**;**), and colons (**:**). You can also use a character as the separator. </li><li>**Text Identifier**: specifies the identifier for the text content. Single quotation marks (**'**) and double quotation marks (**"**) are supported. </li><li>**Line Break Symbol**: specifies the line break symbol. The following characters are supported: **\\n**, **\\r**, and **\\r\\n**. </li></ul> |
   | Batch Commit Quantity | This parameter specifies the number of rows exported that triggers the database to perform an autocommit when the data is exported as a file in the SQL format. In other words, a `COMMIT` command is added to the exported file each time when the specified amount of data is exported.  |
   | Use Global Snapshot | If you select this option, ODC exports the data in the latest global snapshot of the specified table to ensure global data consistency.  |

7. Configure schema file settings.

   - If you have selected **Export Schema Only** for **Export Content**, you can select **Merge Exported Results into an SQL File**. After you select this option, DDL statements are merged and exported as one SQL file.

   - Choose whether to select **Add DROP TABLE Statement before CREATE TABLE Statement**. If you select this option, a `DROP` statement is added before the corresponding `CREATE` statement of an object when the schema files of the object are exported.

8. Select the task execution mode.

   Select **Execute Now** or **Scheduled Execution**.

9. Complete the settings in the **sys Tenant Settings** section.

   a. Choose whether to select the **Use sys Tenant Account to Accelerate Import Task** option. If you select this option, you must also specify **Account** and **Password**.

   b. Click **Test Connection** next to the password field to verify whether the account information is correct. By default, the account for the connection settings is automatically filled in. If the connection fails, we recommend that you change the password for this export.

     <main id="notice" type='notice'>
      <h4>Notice</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>The account and password of the sys tenant are the account and password of a user in a cluster tenant. Do not enter <code>@sys#cluster</code> in the <strong>Account</strong> field. For example, you can set the account to <code>odc</code> and password to <code>*******</code>. </li>
      <li>If no account of the sys tenant is specified, the import/export will be slow.<strong></strong> </li>
      </ul>
     </main>

10. Choose whether to retain the current settings.

    You can select **Retain Current Configuration** in the lower-right corner to save the current data file and schema file settings.

11. Generate an export task.

    After you specify all preceding information, you can click **Export** in the lower-right corner of the panel to create an export task.
