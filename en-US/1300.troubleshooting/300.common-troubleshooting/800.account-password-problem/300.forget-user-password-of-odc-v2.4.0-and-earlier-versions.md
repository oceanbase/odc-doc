Forgot an account password in ODC V2.4.0 or earlier
=============================================

Symptom
-------------------------

In ODC V2.4.0 and earlier, users register accounts by themselves. The password cannot be retrieved or reset after it is forgotten.

Possible causes
-------------------------

ODC V3.1.1 and earlier versions do not have the administrator role and do not provide the password reset and retrieval feature.

Affected versions
----------------------

ODC V2.4.0 and earlier

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
   <h4>Notice</h4>
   <p>ODC V2.4.0 is no longer maintained by the OceanBase development team. We recommend that you upgrade ODC to V3.2.0 or later. ODC V3.2.0 allows the administrator to reset the logon password of an ordinary user on the <strong>User Management</strong> page in the public resource console.  In this case, <strong>do not use</strong> the solution described in this topic. </p>

Solutions
---------------------

Connect to ODC MetaDB and modify the password field in the user table to reset the password.

User passwords in ODC V2.4.0 and earlier are stored in plaintext and can be directly modified. We strongly recommend that you no longer use ODC V2.4.0 and earlier. Passwords stored in plaintext are insecure.

To change an account password, modify the `password` field in the user table:

```sql
update odc_user_info set `password`='your password' where email='your account';
```
