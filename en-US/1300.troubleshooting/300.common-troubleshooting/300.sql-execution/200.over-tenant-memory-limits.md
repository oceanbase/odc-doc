`Over tenant memory limits` is reported during SQL execution
=======================================================

Symptom
---------------------

The `tenant resource overlimit` error is returned when an SQL statement is executed in the SQL window.

Possible causes
-------------------------

`Over tenant memory limits` is an OBServer error caused by depletion of tenant resources.

Solutions
-------------------------

You can solve this issue by adding tenant resources. To view the tenant information of an OBServer node, perform the following steps:

1. Use the sys tenant to log on to the cluster.

2. Query the resource pool of the tenant.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM __all_resource_pool;
   ```

3. Query the resource unit of the tenant.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM __all_unit_config;
   ```

4. Change the memory ratio of the tenant.

   ```sql
   ALTER resource unit XXX_config max_cpu = x ,min_cpu = x ,max_memory ='xxxG',min_memory= 'xxxG';
   ```
