Disconnection during SQL execution
==================================

Symptom
-------------------------

When an SQL statement is executed for a period, ODC reports a disconnection.

Possible causes
-------------------------

* The proxy server has timed out. You can check the response to the `sql-execute` request in the browser in debugging mode.

   Error message example: The `504 Gateway Time-out` error is returned for the request.

* The browser running in the background did not send a heartbeat packet to ODC. ODC, therefore, determines that the connection is no longer in use and disconnects it.

   Check whether the browser supports heartbeat requests in debugging mode:

Solutions
-------------------------

### **Proxy server configuration issues**

You can modify the proxy server configuration to ensure that the timeout period is long enough.

1. Modify the NGINX configuration.

2. Add the following proxy configuration.

   ```shell
   proxy_read_timeout 1800;
   proxy_send_timeout 1800;
   proxy_connect_timeout 75;
   proxy_next_upstream off;
   ```

   <main id="notice" type='notice'>
      <h4>Notice</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>We recommend that you set <code>proxy_connect_timeout</code> to a value no greater than 75 seconds. For more information, see <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_connect_timeout">proxy_connect_timeout time</a>.</li>
      <li><code>proxy_next_upstream off</code> prohibits NGINX from forwarding requests to the next ODC node. As a result, you must log on to the ODC node again and some file upload and download features of ODC are unavailable. These features include database change tasks and file download/upload-related features such as the download of result sets. </li>
      </ul>
   </main>

3. After the modification, restart the NGINX proxy.

### **Browser running in the background**

If the browser does not send heartbeat requests in the background, you must perform some operations on the ODC page when executing long and time-consuming SQL statements. This ensures that the frontend always sends heartbeat requests. In most operating systems, a browser does not send heartbeat requests and no CPU resource is allocated to the browser when it is running in the background. As a result, if you do not perform operations on the ODC page for a long time, the connection is interrupted.
