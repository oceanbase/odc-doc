```shell
ErrorCode = 1317, SQLState = 70100, Details = (conn=405741) Query timed out
```

### Possible causes

The execution time of the SQL statement exceeds the timeout period set by ODC at the driver layer.

`Timeout` is returned during SQL execution
--------------------------------------

### Symptom

The `Timeout` error is reported when an SQL statement is executed in the SQL window.

The following error message is returned:

```shell
ORA-00600: internal error code, arguments: -4012, Timeout
```

### Possible causes

The execution time of the SQL statement exceeds the value of `ob_query_timeout`.

### Affected versions

All versions of client ODC and web ODC

### Solutions

#### **ODC versions earlier than V4.2.0**

In ODC, choose **Sessions** > **Session Properties** > **Session Variables** and set `ob_query_timeout` to a large value to prevent server-level queries from timing out.

#### ODC V4.2.0 and later

In the SQL window of ODC, choose **O&M** > **Global Variables** > **Session Properties** and set the value of `ob_query_timeout` to a large one to prevent server-level queries from timing out.
