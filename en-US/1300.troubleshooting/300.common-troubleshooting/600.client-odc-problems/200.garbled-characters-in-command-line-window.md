**Possible causes**
-----------------

The command-line window of ODC is integrated with OBClient. You must use OBClient to change the default client character set of the database to the character set of the operating system.

The default character set of the Windows operating system is GBK. Windows cannot automatically match the character set of the OBClient. As a result, the character set of the OBClient is inconsistent with that of the operating system.

**Affected versions**
-----------------------

All versions of client ODC for Windows

**Solutions**
-------------------------

Run `set names gbk` manually in the command-line window of ODC.
