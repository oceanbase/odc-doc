`Not a valid secret key` is returned for connection creation in client ODC
=======================================================

Symptom
-------------

A parameter error is returned for connection creation, deletion, or modification in client ODC.

The following error message is returned:

```shell
Not a valid secret key
```

Possible causes
-------------

ODC V2.4.1 and later versions have introduced password encryption algorithms for secure password storage. Earlier versions of Java implement export restrictions on high-strength encryption algorithms, such as AES256, and report the following error for AES256:

```java
java.security.InvalidKeyException:  Illegal  key  size  or  default  parameters
```

Affected versions
--------------

Client ODC versions without JRE in the installation package

Solutions
-------------

### **Solution 1: Upgrade ODC**

Installation packages of client ODC V3.2.0 and later versions contain the JRE installation package (including JRE for macOS and for Windows 64-bit). We recommend that you upgrade client ODC to V3.2.0 or later.

### **Solution 2: Upgrade Java**

Upgrade Java to 1.8.0_200 or later.

### **Solution 3: Replace the corresponding JAR files**

1. Copy the following two files to the `${JAVA_HOME}/jre/lib/security` directory in the corresponding path of the JRE.

   * local_policy.jar

   * US_export_policy.jar

2. Download and decompress the policy file [ðŸ“Žjava8-policy-jar.zip](https://yuque.antfin.com/attachments/lark/0/2021/zip/188311/1619413822328-d72515da-2fba-4f13-9478-026c270e3d68.zip).

3. Restart the Java program.
