Connection times out
======================================

Symptom
---------------------

The `Timeout` error is returned for a connection trial or test.

The following error message is returned:

```shell
Failed to execute the SQL statement. Error details: Could not connect to address=(host=some.domain.com)(port=22)(type=master) : Could not connect to some.domain.com : Read timed out
```

`timeout` errors may be divided into the following types:

* connect timeout

* read timeout

* socket timeout

**Possible causes**
--------------------------

| **Error message** | **Possible causes** |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| connect timeout | <ul><li>The network is inaccessible. </li><li>The network is unstable. </li></ul> |
| read timeout | <ul><li> The port is reachable, but is not a valid database listening port. For example, the 2882 port can be an internal RPC port of the OBServer node. </li><li>The network is unstable. </li><li>The destination port service is unavailable. </li></ul> |
| socket timeout | The network is unstable.  |



Solutions
-------------------------

### **Check the network configuration of the server where the ODC process runs**

Checklist:

* Check whether the DNS addressing service is normal for an access by using a DNS address.

* Check whether the IP address of the destination OBServer node can be pinged successfully.

* Check whether the VPN and network acceleration features are enabled, which result an unexpected network environment.

* Check the firewall configurations of the local server and the target OBServer node.


### **connect/socket timeout**

1. `connect timeout` and `socket timeout` errors are basically caused by network issues. Use the `ping ${your.ob.ip.address}` command to check whether the destination address is reachable. If the IP address cannot be pinged, the network is disconnected. In this case, contact the network administrator to check the network configuration.

2. Use the `telnet ${your.ob.ip.address} ${your.ob.sql.port}` command to check whether the port is reachable. If the IP address can be pinged but the port is unreachable, the firewall may prohibit the port from accessing specific IP addresses, or the specified port is not listened by the corresponding program.




### **read timeout**

1. Check for network issues as described above. If the IP address can be pinged, it is reachable, but the port is not the database listening port. In this case, check whether the destination port is specified correctly.

2. If the port number is correct, the database service is faulty. Check whether the OBServer node is running as expected.
