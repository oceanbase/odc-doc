# Connection is refused in a connection trial or test

## Symptom

The `Connection refused` error is returned for a connection trial or test.

The following error message is returned:

```plaintext
Failed to execute the SQL statement. Error details: Could not connect to address=(host=some.domain.com)(port=2883)(type=master) : Socket fail to connect to host:some.domain.com, port:1883. Connection refused (Connection refused)
```

Possible causes
-------------------------

`Connection refused` indicates that the network is disconnected. Possible causes:

1. The destination address is unreachable.

2. The port of the destination address is not listened on.

3. The firewall policy of the target server denies the connection request from the client.

Solutions
-------------------------

1. Use the `ping` command to check whether the destination address is reachable. If the address cannot be pinged, the network is disconnected. In this case, contact the network administrator to check the network configuration.

   ```shell
   ping ${your.ob.ip.address}
   ```

2. Use the `telnet` command to check whether the destination port is listening. If the `telnet` command fails, the destination port is unreachable.

   ```shell
    telnet ${your.ob.ip.address} ${your.ob.port}
   ```

3. Use the `iptables` command to check the firewall configuration.



4. On the target server, run the `iptables -nvL` command to view the firewall policy. For more information about the related parameters, see:
