`JSONException` is reported during PL debugging
===========================================

**Symptom**
-----------------

During PL debugging, an unexpected exception, `JSONException`, is reported, and debugging exits.

**Possible causes**
-----------------

This is an OBSever error. During PL debugging, the OBSever returns `NULL` that is not enclosed in double quotation marks. However, in the JSON format, both the key and value must be enclosed in double quotation marks. In the preceding example, `NULL` is not enclosed in double quotation marks, causing an error when ODC parses the JSON string.

Affected versions
----------------------

ODC V3.3.1 and earlier

**Solutions**
-------------------------

1. Upgrade ODC to V3.3.2. We recommend that you upgrade ODC to the latest version. In ODC V3.3.2 and later, ODC does not exit debugging when the OBServer node returns JSON data in an unexpected format.

2. Upgrade OceanBase Database to V3.2.3 or later to resolve this issue from the root.
