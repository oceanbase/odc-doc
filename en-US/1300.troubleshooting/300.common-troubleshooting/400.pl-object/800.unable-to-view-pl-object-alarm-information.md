Alert information of a PL object is unavailable
================================

Symptom
-------------------------

A PL object written in ODC V3.2.1 or earlier for OceanBase Database in Oracle mode is invalid due to syntax or other reasons. The alert information of the invalid PL object is not available.

Possible causes
-------------------------

Currently, the OceanBase driver and ODC do not support the display of alert information.

Affected versions
----------------------

ODC V3.2.1 and earlier

Solutions
---------------------

### **Solution 1**

1. Upgrade ODC to V3.2.2 or later.  We recommend that you upgrade ODC to the latest version for a better experience with PL features.

2. Click the alert icon on the right of the PL object name to view the alert information.

### **Solution 2**

Query for the alert information in an internal table:

```sql
select b.OBJECT_NAME,a.GMT_CREATE,a.ERROR_NUMBER,
a.TEXT
from
  sys.all_virtual_error_agent a,
  all_objects b
where
  a.OBJ_ID = b.OBJECT_ID
  and b.OBJECT_NAME = 'xxx';
```
