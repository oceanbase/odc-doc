PL anonymous block cannot be debugged
===============================

Anonymous block cannot be debugged
----------------------------

### Symptom

After an anonymous block debugging request is initiated in ODC, the debugging request is in a normal state and the breakpoint operation can be performed. However, both single-step execution and batch execution fail.

### Possible causes

The logic for obtaining the error information in debugging stages for an anonymous block debugging request initiated in ODC has a defect. As a result, the system fails to obtain the debugging context information, which serves as the basis of follow-up debugging execution operations, including single-step and batch execution.

### Affected versions

ODC V3.2.2 and earlier

### Solutions

Upgrade ODC to V3.3.0 or later, in which the bug related to anonymous block debugging is fixed. We recommend that you upgrade ODC to the latest version.
