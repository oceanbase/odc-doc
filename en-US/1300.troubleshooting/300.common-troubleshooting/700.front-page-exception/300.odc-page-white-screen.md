White screen in ODC
=========================

**Symptom**
-------------------------

After the access endpoint of web ODC is entered in the browser, no content is displayed or ODC stalls on the loading page.

Possible causes
------------------

ODC has a large number of frontend resources. If the network conditions are poor, ODC takes a long time to load network resources, resulting in a white screen.

Affected versions
----------------------

All versions of web ODC

**Solutions**
-------------------------

1. Go to the debugging panel of the browser. Refresh the page to check whether a large number of frontend resources are in the Pending state.

   <main id="notice" type='notice'>
      <h4>Notice</h4>
      <p>Disable <strong>Filter</strong> or select the <strong>All</strong> option. Otherwise, the browser may filter out requests for static resources. </p>
   </main>

2. If a large number of resources are in the loading state, the white screen is caused by a network issue.

3. If static resources in network requests are quickly loaded, view the output of the console on the current page. If an error is printed, contact OceanBase Technical Support.
