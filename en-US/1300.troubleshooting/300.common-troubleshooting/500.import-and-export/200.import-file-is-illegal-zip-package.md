Invalid ZIP package reported during file import
================================

**Symptom**
-----------------

File importing fails for an import task created in ODC. The following error message is returned:

```shell
"Invalid ZIP package. Error details: The ZIP file is not exported by using ODC or OBDUMPER."
```

**Possible causes**
-----------------

ODC V4.1.1 and earlier do not support the import of files that are exported from ODC V4.1.2 or OBDUMPER V4.1.0 or later.

* When you use ODC V4.1.1 or earlier to import a ZIP file, if the file is not exported by using ODC, or the MANIFEST.bin file has been deleted, the file is identified as invalid.

* Files exported by using OBDUMPER V4.1.0 and later do not necessarily contain the MANIFEST.bin file. Therefore, ODC V4.1.2 and later no longer check for the MANIFEST.bin file. The error occurs because no data file exists in the compressed file or the file path does not match the path requirement of OBLOADER.

Affected versions
----------------------

All versions of client ODC and web ODC

**Solutions**
-------------------------

When you create an import task in ODC, we recommend that you use compressed files exported by using ODC or OBDUMPER. In ODC versions later than V4.1.2, you can import a file compressed in the following directory format:

```xml
export_1
└── data
    ├── TABLE
    │   ├── EMP-schema.sql
    │   ├── EMP.0.0.csv
    │   ├── EMP.0.1.csv
    │   └── EMP_T-schema.sql
    └── VIEW
        ├── EMP_V2-schema.sql
        ├── EMP_VIEW-schema.sql
        └── EMP_V-schema.sql
```
