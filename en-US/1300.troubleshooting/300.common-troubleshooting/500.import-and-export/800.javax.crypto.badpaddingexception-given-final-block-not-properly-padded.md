`javax.crypto.BadPaddingException: Given final block not properly padded` is returned for a data import or export failure
=========================================================================================================

**Symptom**
-------------------------

A data import or export task fails, and the following exception is thrown in the task summary: javax.crypto.BadPaddingException: Given final block not properly padded.

**Possible causes**
-------------------------

This exception is caused because the ODP password failed to be decrypted.

**Solutions**
-------------------------

### Solution 1

We recommend that you install Open JDK 1.8.0_242 or later to ensure consistent versions of JRE and JCE.

### **Solution 2**

Download the jce_policy plug-in of the same version as the JDK being used from the Oracle official website, decompress the package, and then replace the original local_policy.jar and US_export_policy.jar files with those in the decompressed files.

### **Solution 3**

Upgrade ODC to V2.3.0 or a later version. This issue will not occur in ODC V2.3.0 and later versions because the decryption policy is changed.
