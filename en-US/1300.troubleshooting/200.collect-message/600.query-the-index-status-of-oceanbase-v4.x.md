GV$SESSION_LONGOPS view
--------------------------------------

If you use OceanBase Database V4.1.0 or later, you can view the time-consuming tasks of OceanBase Database in the GV$SESSION_LONGOPS view. The GV$SESSION_LONGOPS view provides information about the stage and progress of index creation. The following table describes the fields in the view.

| **Field** | **Type** | **Description** |
|------------------|---------------|------------|
| SID | bigint(20) | The ID of the session. |
| OPNAME | varchar(128) | The name of the DDL operation. |
| TARGET | varchar(128) | The DDL operation object. |
| SVR_IP | varchar(46) | The IP address of the server. |
| SVR_PORT | bigint(20) | The port on the server. |
| START_TIME | bigint(20) | The start time. |
| ELAPSED_SECONDS | DECIMAL(24,4) | The time consumed. |
| TIME_REMAINING | bigint(20) | The estimated remaining time. |
| LAST_UPDATE_TIME | bigint(20) | The record update time. |
| MESSAGE | varchar(500) | The supplementary information. |
| TRACE_ID | varchar(64) | The trace ID. |

View the index creation process
-----------------

Index data completion is the most time-consuming stage in index creation. In some environments, the most time in index creation may be spent in waiting for the concurrent transactions to complete or end.

### Waiting for transaction to end

The index creation task is waiting for the transaction to end. Here is the sample command:

```shell
obclient> select * from oceanbase.gv$session_longops \G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
             SID: -1
        TRACE_ID: YE5186458A15C-0005EF63AE10FBBB-0-0
          OPNAME: create index
          TARGET: __idx_500005_i1
          SVR_IP:
        SVR_PORT: 58648
      START_TIME: 2023-06-09
 ELAPSED_SECONDS: 7
  TIME_REMAINING: 0
LAST_UPDATE_TIME: 2023-06-09
         MESSAGE: TENANT_ID: 1004, TASK_ID: 2, STATUS: WAIT TRANS END, PENDING_TX_ID: 76
```


When the transaction is waiting for completion, the `MESSAGE` field prints `WAIT TRANS END` and the transaction ID of the first uncompleted transaction, such as `PENDING_TX_ID: 76`. You can then query the transaction information in the __all_virtual_trans_stat table by using the `trans_id` field.

### Data completion

You can use the row count metric to determine the overall progress of an index creation task.

Here is the sample code:

```shell
obclient> select * from oceanbase.gv$session_longops \G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
             SID: -1
        TRACE_ID: YFDE80BA2DA8D-0005FDA8116C1F4E-0-0
          OPNAME: create index
          TARGET: 500097
          SVR_IP: 127.1
        SVR_PORT: 65000
      START_TIME: 2023-06-09 17:10:42
 ELAPSED_SECONDS: 5
  TIME_REMAINING: 0
LAST_UPDATE_TIME: 2023-06-09 17:10:48
         MESSAGE: TENANT_ID: 1004, TASK_ID: 541, STATUS: REPLICA BUILD, ROW_SCANNED: 2000000, ROW_SORTED: 4000000, ROW_INSERTED: 503316
1 row in set (0.03 sec)
```

#### Fields in GV$SESSION_LONGOPS

The following table describes the fields for an index creation task.

| **Field** | **Description** |
|------------------|---------------|
| TRACE_ID | The ID of the OBServer program log, which is used to search for related log files.  |
| OPNAME | The operation name. The value is `create index` for an index creation task.  |
| TARGET | The operation object. The value is the name of the index being created for an index creation task.  |
| SVR_IP | The IP address of the OBServer node on which the index creation task is executed.  |
| SVR_PORT | The port number of the OBServer node on which the index creation task is executed.  |
| START_TIME | The start date of index creation. This field is compatible with Oracle databases.  |
| ELAPSED_SECONDS | The time consumed for creating the index in seconds.  |
| TIME_REMAINING | The estimated remaining time. The field is compatible with Oracle databases and is currently not supported.  |
| LAST_UPDATE_TIME | The date when statistics are collected. This field is compatible with Oracle databases.  |
| MESSAGE | The specific information about the index task, which includes the following fields:<ul><li>TENANT_ID: the ID of the tenant. </li><li>TASK_ID: the ID of the DDL task. </li><li>STATUS: the status of DDL execution. For example, `REPLICA BUILD` indicates the data completion stage. </li></ul> |



#### Row count metric in the index data completion phase

Data completion can be divided into three main stages. The following table describes the row count metrics in these stages.

| **Stage** | **Row count metric** | **Description** |
|--------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Primary table scanning | ROW_SCANNED | - |
| Sorting | ROW_SORTED | The sorting stage may involve multiple rounds of compaction. Therefore, the value of `ROW_SORTED` is usually larger than those of `ROW_SCANNED` and `ROW_INSERTED`. The stage also takes a longer time.  |
| Data writing to the index table | ROW_INSERTED | - |

Based on the following fields in the preceding sample code: `ROW_SCANNED: 2000000`, `ROW_SORTED: 4000000`, and `ROW_INSERTED: 503316`, the following conclusions can be made:

* The primary table scanning and sorting stages in data completion have been completed, and the task is now in the last stage, namely, data writing to the index table.

* The total number of data rows is 2,000,000, and the number of rows written to the index table is 503,316, reaching a progress of 503316/2000000, which is about 25%.
