What items are pre-checked when I install client ODC?
-------------------------------------------

The following items are checked for the installation of client ODC:

* Windows operating system (OS) version: Only Windows 7 and later versions are supported.

* Port: Whether port 8989 is occupied is checked. The port will no longer be checked in ODC V2.3.0 and later versions because dynamic ports are used.

* Java runtime environment: For ODC versions earlier than V4.1.0, JDK 1.8.0_242 or later is recommended. The installation package of ODC V4.1.0 or later is provided with a JDK installation package. Therefore, you do not need to check the Java runtime environment.


**How do I view the logs when the installation or startup of client ODC fails?**
--------------------------------------------

### Versions later than ODC V3.3.0

You can view the error information in the main.log file. The storage path of the file varies with the OS.

* Linux: \~/.config/odc/logs

* macOS: \~/Library/Application Support/Logs/odc/logs

* Windows: %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\odc\\logs

### ODC V3.3.0 and earlier

You can view the error information in the main.log file. The storage path of the file varies with the OS.

* Linux: \~/.config/odc/logs (client logs); ~/.config/odc/javalog (server logs)

* macOS: \~/Library/Application Support/Logs/odc/logs (client logs); ~/Library/Application Support/Logs/odc/javalog (server logs)

* Windows: %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\odc\\logs (client logs); %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\odc/javalog (server logs)

**What do I do if I fail to install or start client ODC?**
--------------------------------------------------------

Run the following command to view the Java runtime environment. JDK 1.8.0_242 or later is required. If the version is earlier than 1.8.0_242, update the JDK and restart the computer before reinstalling or starting ODC.

```javascript
java -version
```

**What do I do when client ODC fails to be installed or start and prompts that the software package is damaged?**
--------------------------------------------------

Run the `sudo spctl --master-disable` command and select any source.

**OceanBase Development Center cannot be opened during the installation of ODC on macOS**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The macOS does not support direct installation. For more information about how to securely open applications that are not downloaded from the Apple Store, see [Securely open applications on macOS](https://support.apple.com/zh-cn/guide/mac-help/mchleab3a043/mac).
