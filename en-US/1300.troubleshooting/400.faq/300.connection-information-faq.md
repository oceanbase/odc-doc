Connection information
=========================

**How do I back up the connection information in ODC?**
-------------------------------------

ODC allows you to back up connection and account information and migrate such information from one server to another.

* If you are using web ODC, you can directly migrate or back up the MetaDB that you created during ODC deployment.

* If you are using client ODC, you can back up the `odc2.0.mv.db` file in the user directory. When you need to restore the connection, you can copy this file to the original directory.
