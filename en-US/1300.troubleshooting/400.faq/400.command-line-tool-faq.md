Command-line window
==========================

**After I connect to a database by using client ODC on Windows, the connection is stuck and then disconnected, as shown in the following figure. How do I solve this issue?**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This issue is caused by the lack of the system library files of `msvcp120.dll` and `msvcr120.dll`. Please install the official [Visual Studio patch](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784).

   <h4>Note</h4>
   <p>You do not need to restart the system after installing the Visual Studio patch. We recommend that you update ODC to the latest version. The installation package of the latest ODC version contains the corresponding DLL file, so you do not need to install the patch separately. </p>

ODC command-line window fails to open and `Error Exec_tty error:Unknown reason` is returned
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The issue is caused by insufficient memory resources. Make sure that the current server has sufficient available CPU and memory resources. After you deploy ODC in an environment recommended in [Deploy ODC](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/enterprise-odc-doc-cn-10000000001509741), restart ODC to resolve the issue.
