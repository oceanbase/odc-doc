# Manage partitions

## Background information

- **RANGE partitioning**: Multiple rows with column values in an ordered, continuous, and non-overlapping range are assigned to a partition. For more information, see [Set partitioning rules](../500.sql-development/700.database-objects/100.web-odc-table-objects/200.web-odc-create-a-table.md).

- **Partitioning plan**: When you insert data into a RANGE-partitioned table, if the inserted data exceeds the upper limit of the current range, the operation fails and an error is returned. The partitioning plan feature is an extension of RANGE partitioning. OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) can automatically manage RANGE-partitioned tables based on the specified partitioning strategy, and you do not need to manually create partitions. This facilitates maintenance of the RANGE-partitioned tables.

This topic describes how to apply a partitioning plan in ODC for automatic partition management, including partition creation and deletion.

## Considerations

- Only OceanBase MySQL data sources are supported.

- Only RANGE-partitioned tables that are partitioned based on a Timestamp-type field and RANGE COLUMNS-partitioned tables that are partitioned based on a Date-type field are supported.

## Create a partitioning plan

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
   <h4>Notice</h4>
   <ul>
   <li>In ODC V4.0.0 and later, the partitioning plan feature is supported only for RANGE-partitioned tables that are partitioned based on a Timestamp-type field and for RANGE COLUMNS-partitioned tables that are partitioned based on a Date-type field. If a RANGE- or RANGE COLUMNS-partitioned table that is partitioned based on a field of another type exists, ODC will skip creating partitioning plans of this type and record a warning log. </li>
   <li>By default, a partitioning plan is executed on the hour. </li>
   </ul>
</main>

Example: Create two partitions for the `odc_test` database in the `mysql410` data source every three months. The created partitions are retained for 12 months.

| Parameter | Example value |
| ------ | ------ |
| Project name | odc_4.2.0 |
| Data source | mysql410 |
| Database name | odc_test |

1. On the **Ticket** tab of the SQL window, choose **Partitioning Plan** > **Create Partitioning Plan**.

2. In the **Create Partitioning Plan** panel, configure the following parameters.

   ![2](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/422/800.data-Lifecycle-management/300.partition-scheme/2EN.png)

   | **Parameter** | **Description** |
   |---------|------------|
   | Data Source | The data source to which the partitioning plan belongs. The default value is the current data source.  |
   | Partitioning Strategy | The partitioning strategy. Search for and select a RANGE-partitioned table in the database and edit its partitioning strategy.  <ul><li> You can select **Show Only Tables Without Partitioning Strategies** next to **Partition Strategy** to display only tables with no partitioning strategies.  </li><li> You can also select multiple RANGE-partitioned tables and configure a partitioning strategy for them at a time. </li><li> In the **Partition policy** column, click the edit icon and then you can edit the number of partitions to create, partitioning interval, retention period, and naming rules. <ul><li> **Number of Partitions**: the number of partitions to create. </li><li> **Partition Interval**: the interval for creating partitions, in the unit of day, month, or year. </li><li> **Retention Period**: the retention period of partitions, in the unit of day, month, or year. After the specified retention period elapses, the created partitions are automatically deleted.  <br>Example: Set the number of partitions to 1, partition interval to 1 Month, and retention period to 12 month, which specifies to create one partition for the current table every month and to automatically delete partitions that were created one month ago.<br>  ![3](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/422/800.data-Lifecycle-management/300.partition-scheme/3.0EN.png)</li></ul></li></ul> |
   | Remarks | The business background of the project, such as the change purpose and expected goal.  |
