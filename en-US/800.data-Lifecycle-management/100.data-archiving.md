# Archive data

## Background information

When the amount of data in an online database increases, the query performance and business operations may be affected. OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) allows you to periodically archive table data from one database to another to address this issue.

This topic describes how to archive data by submitting a ticket.

## Technical mechanism

![1](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/422/800.data-Lifecycle-management/200.data-cleaning/1EN.png)

## Prerequisites

The table to be archived has a primary key.

## Considerations

- Pay attention to the following rules:

   - You must connect to an OceanBase data source by using OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP). At present, you cannot archive data in a directly connected OceanBase data source.

   - At present, an OceanBase data source must be a cluster instance. Therefore, you must configure the cluster instance name when you create an OceanBase data source.

   - If the data sources of the source and destination are of different types, the destination table cannot be automatically created.

   - Make sure that the fields in the source table are compatible with those at the destination. The data archiving service does not handle field compatibility issues.

   - CPU and memory exhaustion prevention is not supported for a MySQL data source.

- The following archive links are supported:

   - Links between MySQL tenants of OceanBase Database

   - Links between MySQL databases

   - Links from a MySQL database to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database

   - Links from a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database to a MySQL database

- Data archiving is not supported in the following cases:

   - The source table does not have a primary key.

   - The source table contains fields of the bit, enum, set, xml, or geometry data type.

   - The archiving condition contains a LIMIT clause.

   - The source table contains a foreign key.

## Create a data archiving task

Example: Archive the `student` table in the `odc_test` database to the `test` database.

| Parameter | Example value |
| ------ | ------ |
| Data source | mysql_4.2.0 |
| Source database name | odc_test |
| Destination database name | test |
| Table name | student |

1. On the **Ticket** tab in the left-side navigation pane of the homepage, click **Data Archiving** and then click **Create New**.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |--------|-------|
   | Source Database | The database to which the table belongs. <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>In ODC V4.2.2 and later, you can archive data from a MySQL database to OceanBase Database. </p></main> |
   | Destination Database | The database to which the table is to be archived. <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>In ODC V4.2.2 and later, you can archive data from OceanBase Database to a MySQL database. </p></main> |
   | Archiving Scope | <ul><li>**Partial Archiving**: specifies to archive only tables that meet filtering conditions in the source database. <br>You can configure filtering conditions by using constants or referencing variables defined in **Variable Configuration**. For example, in `create<'${create_time}'`, `create_time` is the name of a variable configured in **Variable Configuration** and `create` is a field in the table to be archived. </li><li>**Database Archiving**: specifies to archive all tables in the source database. </li></ul> |
   | Custom Variable | Optional. You can define variables and set time offsets to filter rows to be archived.  |
   | Execution Mode | The execution mode of the task. Valid values: **Execute Now**, **Scheduled Execution**, and **Periodic Execution**.  |
   | Task Settings | <ul><li>**Insert Policy**: Choose whether to ignore or update duplicate data during data archiving. </li><li>**Set Limit**: Specify **Row Limit** and *Data Size Limit**.</li></ul> |
   | Remarks | Optional. Additional information about the task, which cannot exceed 200 characters in length.  |
3. Click **Create**.

4. After the task is generated, choose **Ticket** > **Data Archiving** to view the task.
