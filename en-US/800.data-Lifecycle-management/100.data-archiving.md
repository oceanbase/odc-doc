# Archive data

This topic describes how to archive data by submitting a ticket.

## Background information

When the amount of data in an online database increases, the query performance and business operations may be affected. OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) allows you to periodically archive table data from one database to another to address this issue.

The example in this topic describes how to create a data archiving task in ODC to archive the `employee` table in the `odc_test` database to the `test2` database in the same project.

## Prerequisites

The table to be archived has a primary key.

## Considerations

- Pay attention to the following rules:

   - You must connect to an OceanBase data source by using OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) instead of directly connecting to it.

   - When you archive data from one Oracle tenant to another in OceanBase Database, table schema synchronization is not supported.

   - At present, an OceanBase data source must be a cluster instance. Therefore, you must configure the cluster instance name when you create an OceanBase data source.

   - Make sure that the fields in the source table are compatible with those at the destination. The data archiving service does not handle field compatibility issues.

   - CPU and memory exhaustion prevention is not supported for a MySQL data source.

- The following archive links are supported:

   - Links between MySQL tenants of OceanBase Database

   - Links between Oracle tenants of OceanBase Database (table schema synchronization not supported)

   - Links between MySQL databases

   - Links from a MySQL database to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database

   - Links from a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database to a MySQL database

- Data archiving is not supported in the following cases:

   - The source table in the MySQL or OceanBase MySQL data source does not have a primary key or non-null unique index.

   - The source table in the OceanBase Oracle data source does not have a primary key.

   - The source table in the OceanBase Oracle data source contains fields of the JSON or XMLType data type.

   - The version of the OceanBase Oracle data source is V4.3.0 or later.

   - The version of the OceanBase MySQL data source is V4.3.1 or later.

   - The archiving condition contains a `LIMIT` clause.

   - The source table contains a foreign key.

## Create a data archiving task

1. In the SQL window, create a table named `employee` by using an SQL statement.

   ![1](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/430/800.data-Lifecycle-management/100.data-archiving/1EN.png)

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE `employee` (
   `emp_no` int(120) NOT NULL COMMENT 'employee number',
    `birthday` date DEFAULT NULL COMMENT 'employee birthday',
    `name` varchar(120) DEFAULT NULL COMMENT 'employee name',
    `time` date NOT NULL COMMENT 'time' COMMENT 'create time',
    PRIMARY KEY (`time`)
   ) partition by range columns(time) (
    partition p2023_01
    values
     less than ('2023-01-01'),
     partition p2023_02
   values
     less than ('2023-02-01')
   )
   ```

2. On the **Tickets** tab in the left-side navigation pane of the homepage, click **Data Archiving** and then click **Create New**.

3. In the **Create Data Archiving Task** panel, configure the following parameters.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |--------|-------|
   | Source Database | The database to which the table belongs. <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>In ODC V4.2.2 and later, you can archive data from a MySQL database to OceanBase Database. </p></main> |
   | Target Database | The database to which the table is to be archived. <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>In ODC V4.2.2 and later, you can archive data from OceanBase Database to a MySQL database. </p></main> |
   | Archiving Scope | <ul><li>**Partial Archiving**: specifies to archive only tables that meet filtering conditions in the source database. <ul><li>You can configure filtering conditions by using constants or referencing variables defined in **Custom Variable**. For example, in `time<'${create_time}'`, `create_time` is the name of a variable configured in **Custom Variable** and `time` is a field in the table to be archived. </li><li>You can select **Specify Partition** and specify the partitions to be archived. </li></ul></li><li>**Database Archiving**: specifies to archive all tables in the source database. </li></ul> |
   | Custom Variable | Optional. You can define variables and set time offsets to filter rows to be archived.  |
   | Execution Mode | The execution mode of the task. Valid values: **Execute Now**, **Scheduled Execution**, and **Periodic Execution**.  |
   | Task Settings | <ul><li>**Specify Task Duration**: You can select this option and specify a duration for the task. If the task is not completed within the specified duration, it will be suspended and wait for the next scheduling. </li><li>**Synchronize Source and Target Table Schemas**: You can select this option to compare the table schemas of the source and destination before the archiving task is scheduled. If they are inconsistent, the source table is skipped. </li><li>**Insert Policy**: You can choose whether to ignore or update duplicate data during data archiving. </li><li>**Set Limit**: You can specify **Row Limit** and **Data Size Limit**. </li></ul> |
   | Description | Optional. Additional information about the task, which cannot exceed 200 characters in length.  |
3. Click **Create**, preview the SQL statement for archiving, and click **OK**.
