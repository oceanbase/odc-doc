# Manage partitioning plans

This topic describes how to apply a partitioning plan in OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) for automatic partition management, including partition creation and deletion.

## Background information

The partitioning plan feature is an extension of RANGE partitioning. ODC can automatically manage RANGE-partitioned tables based on the specified partitioning strategies, and you do not need to manually create partitions. This facilitates maintenance of the RANGE-partitioned tables.

- **RANGE partitioning**: It is the most common partitioning type and is generally used in combination with dates. In RANGE partitioning, the database maps rows to partitions based on ranges of partitioning key values. For more information, see [Set partitioning rules](../../500.sql-development/700.database-objects/100.web-odc-table-objects/200.web-odc-create-a-table.md) and [Partitioning types](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-cn-1000000000642704).

- **Partitioning plan**: When you insert data into a RANGE-partitioned table, if the inserted data exceeds the upper limit of the current range, the operation fails and an error is returned.

- **Creation strategy**: Table data is divided into corresponding partitions based on the specified time interval and data range. Two partition creation methods are supported:

   - **Sequentially Increase**: This method applies only to fields of a time type.

   - **Custom**: You can define a custom SQL expression for partitioning for any field type.

- **Deletion strategy**: Based on the specified number of partitions allowed, the latest partitions are retained and redundant partitions are deleted.

## Partitioning plan execution process

![3](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/424/800.data-Lifecycle-management/300.partition-scheme/310.manage-partition-scheme/3EN.png)

1. Set a partition creation strategy and a partition deletion strategy for a table.
2. Set a strategy execution period.
3. Approve the task process.
4. Execute the partitioning plan.

## Considerations

- Only OceanBase MySQL and OceanBase Oracle data sources are supported.

- Only RANGE-partitioned tables are supported.

- When the upper bound of the last partition in a RANGE-partitioned table reaches the value specified by `MAXVALUE`, no partition can be created. In this case, you cannot configure partitioning strategies in the **Create Partitioning Plan** panel.

- By default, a partitioning plan is executed on the hour.

- If a database already has a partitioning plan, the new partitioning plan will overwrite the existing one once it is approved.

- Creating partitions for a table within a table group can fail or break the load balancing status. Proceed with caution when you decide to configure a partition creation strategy for such a table.

- Creating partitions for a table within a table group can invalidate the table group, because tables in the same table group must have the same number of partitions.

- Deleting partitions from a table that contains a global index will invalidate the global index. Proceed with caution. Choosing to rebuild the global index may cause business issues due to the time-consuming process or online issues resulting from rebuilding failures.

- The option of rebuilding global indexes is provided only in Oracle mode. In MySQL mode, global indexes will be rebuilt by default.

## Create a partitioning plan

Example: Create a partition for the `order` table in the `test_424` database in the `mysql424` data source at a time interval of 1 month.

| Parameter | Example value |
| ------ | ------ |
| Project name | odc_4.2.0 |
| Data source | mysql424 |
| Database name | test_424 |
| Table name | order |

1. In the SQL window, write an SQL statement to create a table named `order`.

   ![4](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/424/800.data-Lifecycle-management/300.partition-scheme/310.manage-partition-scheme/4EN.png)

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE `order` (
   `time` date NOT NULL,
    `parti_key` int(11),
    `name` varchar(120) DEFAULT NULL
   ) partition by range columns(time, parti_key)
   (partition p2023_01 values less than ('2023-01-01', 20230101),
   partition p2023_02 values less than ('2023-02-01', 20230201))
   ```

2. On the **Tickets** tab of the SQL window, choose **Partitioning Plan** > **Create Partitioning Plan**.

3. In the **Create Partitioning Plan** panel, configure the following parameters.

   ![6](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/424/800.data-Lifecycle-management/300.partition-scheme/310.manage-partition-scheme/6EN.png)

   | **Parameter** | **Description** |
   |---------|------------|
   | Database | Select the database for which the partitioning plan is created.  |
   | Partitioning Strategy | Select the target RANGE-partitioned table in the specified database and click ![edit](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/icon/edit.jpg) to set partitioning strategies. For more information, see [Set partitioning strategies](320.set-partition-strategy.md) and [Examples](330.partition-strategy-procedure.md). <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><ul><li>You can select the <strong>Show Only Tables Without Partitioning Strategies</strong> option next to <strong>Partitioning Strategy</strong> to display only tables with no partitioning strategies. </li><li>You can also select multiple RANGE-partitioned tables and configure partitioning strategies for them at a time.  |
   | Strategy Execution Cycles | <ol><li>**Creation Strategy Execution Period**: Set an execution cycle for all **partition creation strategies**, for example, at 2:00 a.m. every day. </li><li>**Customize Deletion Strategy Execution Period**: Select this option and set an execution cycle for all partition deletion strategies. If you do not select this option, the partition deletion strategies will be scheduled together with partition creation strategies.  </li></ol> Example: Set the execution cycle to 3:00 a.m. every day for partition creation strategies, and to 1:00 a.m. every day for partition deletion strategies. The system will execute all partition creation strategies at 3:00 a.m. every day and all partition deletion strategies at 1:00 a.m. every day. <br>![7](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/424/800.data-Lifecycle-management/300.partition-scheme/310.manage-partition-scheme/7EN.png) |
   | Task Settings | Select a method for handling task errors. Valid values:<ul><li> **Abort Task**: This is the default option. When you select this option, the task is aborted if an error occurs when you run the script.  </li><li> **Ignore Error and Continue**: When you select this option, the system skips the statement where an error occurs and continues to execute other statements in the script. </li></ul> |
   | Execution Timeout Value | The default value is 2 hours.  |
   | Remarks | The business background of the project, such as the change purpose and expected goal.  |

4. After you specify the preceding information, click **Submit** in the lower-right corner of the panel.
