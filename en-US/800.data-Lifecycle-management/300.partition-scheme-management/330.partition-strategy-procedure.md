| Parameter | Example value |
| ------ | ------ |
|Project name | odc_4.2.0 |
|Data source | obmysql4.3.0 |
|Database name |odc_test |
|Table name |order |

1. In the SQL window, write an SQL statement to create a table named `order`.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE `order` (
    `time` date NOT NULL,
    `parti_key` int(11),
    `name` varchar(120) DEFAULT NULL
   ) partition by range columns(time, parti_key)
   (partition p2023_01 values less than ('2023-01-01', 20230101),
   partition p2023_02 values less than ('2023-02-01', 20230201))
   ```

2. On the **Tickets** tab of the SQL window, choose **Partitioning Plan** > **Create New**.

5. Set the number of partitions to be created.

6. Configure partition creation rules.

   As shown in the preceding figure, you can set a partition creation strategy for the `time` and `parti_key` partitioning keys in the `order` table.

   - `time`： The data type of this partitioning key is `DATE`, which is a time type. Therefore, you can select **Sequentially Increase** as the creation method. In the example, according to the partition creation strategy for the `time` partitioning key, the current time (the time when the partitioning plan task is run) is used as the reference time and partitions are created at a time interval of 1 month.

   - `parti_key`: The data type of this partitioning key is `INT`, which is not a time type. Therefore, you can select only **Custom** as the creation method. Assume that you need to use the current time as the reference time and create partitions at a time interval of 1 month. According to the description in the **Custom partition creation strategy** section of the “Set partitioning strategies” topic, you can perform the following steps to generate the partitioning expression:

      1. Obtain the reference time for partition creation: The current time is used as the reference time. Therefore, you can directly use the `now()` function.

      2. Set the time interval for generating partitions: In the example, the time interval is 1 month. Therefore, you must enter `1` in the **Interval** field in the **Rule** column in the **Creation Rule** section, and add an interval expression on the basis of the expression generated in Step 1 to generate the next partition. To be specific, the expression is `now () + interval ${INTERVAL} month`, where `${INTERVAL}` is the value of the **Interval** field in the **Rule** column in the **Creation Rule** section.

      3. Generate the partitioning expression of the same data type as the partitioning key: The data type of the `parti_key` partitioning key is `INT` but the expression generated in Step 1 is of a time type. Therefore, you must convert the expression into the `INT` type. You can convert the expression into a numeric string first and then into the `INT` type, namely, `cast(date_format(now() + interval ${INTERVAL} month, '%Y%m01') as signed)`.

         The fields are described as follows:

         - `CAST(xxx AS SIGNED)`: converts a field value into an integer.

         - `DATE_FORMAT()`: converts a field value into the date format.

         - `NOW()`: returns the current date.

         - `INTERVAL ${INTERVAL} MONTH`: an expression that specifies an interval by month. **`${INTERVAL}` is a specific syntax for the time interval function in ODC**.

         - `'%Y%m01'`: the date format.

7. Select a partition naming format.

   As shown in the preceding figure, select **Prefix + Suffix** for **Naming Convention**. This way, the name of a generated partition comprises a fixed string prefix and a time-based variable suffix.

   1. Fixed prefix: You can define a prefix as needed.

   2. Variable suffix: You can select the upper bound of the partition corresponding to the partitioning key of a time type as the suffix of the name of the current partition. You can also select the formatted output format of time and the increment interval of time.

   3. After the configuration, click **Test Generation** to view the partition name.

8. In the <strong>Delete Partitions</strong> section, set the number of partitions to retain and choose whether to rebuild indexes after deletion.

9. Click **Preview SQL** in the lower-right corner of the **Configure partitioning strategy** panel to view the SQL statement generated by the configured partitioning strategies.

10. Click **OK**.

   (partition "p2024_01" values less than (TO_DATE(' 2024-01-01 00:00:00', 'SYYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS', 'NLS_CALENDAR=GREGORIAN'),20240101),
   partition "p2024_02" values less than (TO_DATE(' 2024-02-01 00:00:00', 'SYYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS', 'NLS_CALENDAR=GREGORIAN'),20240201));
   ```

5. Set the number of partitions to be created.

6. Configure partition creation rules.

   As shown in the preceding figure, you can set a partition creation strategy for the `TIME` and `KEY` partitioning keys in the `order` table.

   - `TIME`: The data type of this partitioning key is `DATE`, which is a time type. Therefore, you can select **Sequentially Increase** as the creation method. In the example, according to the partition creation strategy for the `TIME` partitioning key, the current time (the time when the partitioning plan task is run) is used as the reference time and partitions are created at a time interval of 1 month.

   - `KEY`: The data type of this partitioning key is `NUMBER`, which is not a time type. Therefore, you can select only **Custom** as the creation method. Assume that you need to use the current system time as the reference time and create partitions at a time interval of 1 month. According to the description in the **Custom partition creation strategy** section of the “Set partitioning strategies” topic, you can perform the following steps to generate the partitioning expression:

      1. Obtain the reference time for partition creation: The current time is used as the reference time. Therefore, you can directly use the `sysdate` function.

      2. Set the time interval for generating partitions: In the example, the time interval is 1 month. Therefore, you must enter `NUMTOYMINTERVAL(1, 'MONTH')` in the **Interval** field in the **Rule** column in the **Creation Rule** section, and add an interval expression on the basis of the expression generated in Step 1 to generate the next partition. To be specific, the expression is `SYSDATE + ${INTERVAL}`, where `${INTERVAL}` is the value of the **Interval** field in the **Rule** column in the **Creation Rule** section.

      3. Generate the partitioning expression of the same data type as the partitioning key: The data type of the `KEY` partitioning key is `NUMBER` but the expression generated in Step 1 is of a time type. Therefore, you must convert the expression into the `NUMBER` type. You can convert the expression into a numeric string first and then into the `NUMBER` type, namely, `TO_CHAR(SYSDATE + ${INTERVAL}, 'YYYYMM"01"')`.

         The fields are described as follows:

         - `TO_CHAR`: converts a field value into the character type.

         - `SYSDATE`: returns the current system time.

         - `YYYYMM"01"`: the date format.

7. Select a partition naming format.

   As shown in the preceding figure, select **Prefix + Suffix** for **Naming Convention**. This way, the name of a generated partition comprises a fixed string prefix and a time-based variable suffix.

   1. Fixed prefix: You can define a prefix as needed.

   2. Variable suffix: You can select the upper bound of the partition corresponding to the partitioning key of a time type as the suffix of the name of the current partition. You can also select the formatted output format of time and the increment interval of time.

   3. After the configuration, click **Test Generation** to view the partition name.

8. In the <strong>Delete Partitions</strong> section, set the number of partitions to retain and choose whether to rebuild indexes after deletion.

9. Click **Preview SQL** in the lower-right corner of the **Configure partitioning strategy** panel to view the SQL statement generated by the configured partitioning strategies.
