# Clean up data

This topic describes how to clean up archived data by submitting a ticket.

## Background information

After you archive data in the source database to the destination database, OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) allows you to delete the data from the source database to improve the query performance and reduce the online storage costs.

The example in this topic describes how to create a data cleanup task to clean up the `employee` table in the `test2` database in ODC.

## Technical mechanism

![1](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/422/800.data-Lifecycle-management/200.data-cleaning/1EN.png)

## Prerequisites

- The table to be cleaned up has a primary key.

## Considerations

- Pay attention to the following rules:

   - You must connect to an OceanBase data source by using OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) instead of directly connecting to it.

   - At present, an OceanBase data source must be a cluster instance. Therefore, you must configure the cluster instance name when you create an OceanBase data source.

   - CPU and memory exhaustion prevention is not supported for a MySQL data source.

- Supported data sources for data cleanup are as follows:

   - OceanBase MySQL data sources

   - OceanBase Oracle data sources

   - MySQL data sources

- Data cleanup is not supported in the following cases:

   - The source table in the MySQL or OceanBase MySQL data source does not have a primary key or non-null unique index.

   - The source table in the OceanBase Oracle data source does not have a primary key.

   - The source table in the OceanBase Oracle data source contains fields of the JSON or XMLType data type.

   - The version of the OceanBase Oracle data source is V4.3.0 or later.

   - The version of the OceanBase MySQL data source is V4.3.1 or later.

   - The cleanup condition contains a `LIMIT` clause.

   - The table contains a foreign key.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |--------|-------|
   | Need Verification Before Cleanup | You can select this option to choose to verify whether the data in the table to be cleaned up is consistent with that in the destination table. If not, the cleanup will not be executed.  |
   | Source Database | The database to which the table belongs.  |
   | Target Database | The database to which the destination table belongs.  |
   | Cleanup Scope | <ul><li>**Partially Cleaned**: specifies to clean up only tables that meet filtering conditions in the database. <ul><li>You can configure filtering conditions by using constants or referencing variables defined in **Custom Variable**. For example, in `time<'${create_time}'`, `create_time` is the name of a variable configured in **Custom Variable** and `time` is a field in the table to be cleaned up. </li><li>You can select **Specify Partition** and specify the partitions to be cleaned up. </li></ul></li><li>**Whole Library Cleaning**: specifies to clean up all tables in the database. </li></ul> |
   | Custom Variable | Optional. You can define variables and set time offsets to filter rows to be cleaned up.  |
   | Execution Mode | The execution mode of the task. Valid values: **Execute Now**, **Scheduled Execution**, and **Periodic Execution**.  |
   | Task Settings | Configure a throttling strategy. <ul><li>**Specify Task Duration**: You can select this option and specify a duration for the task. If the task is not completed within the specified duration, it will be suspended and wait for the next scheduling. </li><li>**Row Limit**: limits the total number of data rows operated per second. </li><li>**Data Size Limit**: limits the total size of data operated per second. </li><li>**Use Primary Key for Cleanup**: specifies whether to use the primary key to clean up data. </li></ul> |
   | Description | Optional. Additional information about the task, which cannot exceed 200 characters in length.  |
3. Click **Create**, preview the SQL statement for data cleanup, and click **OK**.
