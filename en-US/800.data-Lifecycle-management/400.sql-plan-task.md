# SQL plan task

This topic describes how to create and manage SQL plan tasks in ODC.

## Background information

OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) can periodically execute SQL scripts created by users to complete database development and O&M tasks as required by the users. For example, ODC can periodically execute stored procedures, backup, and database and table schema synchronization.

After a user creates an SQL plan task in **Task Center**, the administrator can approve the task on the Tasks page in Task Center. The user can view the task information and approval status on the Tasks page in Task Center.

## Create an SQL plan task

Assume that you want to create a task to query the `employee` table on the 2nd and 29th of each month.
