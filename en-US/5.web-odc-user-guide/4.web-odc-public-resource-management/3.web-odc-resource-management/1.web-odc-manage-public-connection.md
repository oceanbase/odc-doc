Manage public connections 
==============================================



Overview 
-----------------------------

OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) allows you to create private and public connections. A private connection is created in ODC by a user who obtains the database access information that is not shared with all users for the sake of security. The administrator can create public connections in ODC, and combine multiple public connections to create resource groups. In this way, users in a resource group can use the public connections in this group. 

Log on to ODC as the administrator and go to the **Public Resource Console** page. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Resource Management** \> **Public Connections** to display the **Public Connections** page.
