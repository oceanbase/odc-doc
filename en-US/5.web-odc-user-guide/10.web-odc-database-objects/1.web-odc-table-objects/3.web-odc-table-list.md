Table list 
===============================



Overview 
-----------------------------

Log on to OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) and click the name of the target connection to go to the corresponding connection management page. You can click **Table** in the left-side navigation pane to get a list of tables. 

The table list displays the table objects in the current database. In the table list, you can view the [structure tree](#structure-tree) of an object. You can also right-click the target object to perform some [management actions](#management-actions) on the object.

Structure tree 
-----------------------

You can click the expand icon before the name of the target table in the table list, and the structure tree of the table is displayed in a drop-down list, as shown in the following figure. The structure tree of a table can have up to three levels. When you right-click an item in the tree, the shortcut menu displays some actions that you can perform on the item. For more information about these actions, see the **[Management actions](#management-actions)** section. In this section, you can find the table describing the management options.![Image 188](#image-188)

Management actions 
---------------------------

Right-click the target object in the structure tree. A shortcut menu appears, displaying some management options provided by ODC for you to conveniently manage the target object. 

The following table describes the management options.
