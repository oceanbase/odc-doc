Install ODC 
================================

To manage your database, you can either access the web-based OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) console from OceanBase, or download the ODC client. Unlike the web-based ODC console that provides a logon portal, the ODC client uses a default user account for user identification. You just need to install the client and [create a connection](3.client-odc-connect-database/1.client-odc-create-connection.md) to connect to your database.

|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Operating system (OS) | Windows: Windows 7 or Windows 10 Mac: 10.13.6 (17G65)                                           |
| Java environment      | JDK 1.8.0_242 and later.                                                                                        |
| Port number           | Thanks to the dynamic port detection technology, you do not need to reserve port 8989 for ODC V2.3.0 and later. |
| CPU                   | X86-64 processor with 2 or more cores.                                                                          |
| Memory                | 4 GB or above.                                                                                                  |



Procedure 
------------------

1. Download [ODC Client](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/apsaradb-for-oceanbase/latest/download-the-odc-client?spm=a2c63.p38356.0.0.583c65849lfBPq).

   

2. Double-click the installation file you downloaded to start the installation.

   

3. The setup wizard prompts you to select an installation directory.

   

4. When you run the client after installation, it checks the environment. If the environment does not meet the requirements, the client displays an error message, indicating that you can either continue using the application, or end the process to fix the problem of the environment. If ODC passes the environment check and operates normally, you can create a connection.
