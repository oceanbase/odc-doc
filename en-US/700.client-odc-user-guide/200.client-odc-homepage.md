Manage database connections 
------------------------------------------------

The ODC homepage provides the **Private Connection** tab that shows the connections you have created in a list. 

On the **All Connections** tab, you can [create a private connection](../7.client-odc-user-guide/3.client-odc-connect-database/1.client-odc-create-connection.md), and search for, filter, sort, and refresh connections.


# View session history

On the ODC homepage, you can click **History** in the left-side navigation pane to go to the session history page.

The page shows a list that has the following columns.


| Column | Description |

| Connection Name | The name of the connection you accessed.  |
| Database/Schema Name | The name of the database or schema that you accessed by using the connection.  |
| Recently Opened At | The time when you last accessed the connection.  |

In the lower-left corner of the ODC homepage, choose **Me** > **Preferences**. The **Edit Personal Settings** panel appears.

Set an application password 
------------------------------------------------

You do not need to log on when you start Client ODC, because a default user is used. For security purposes, Client ODC allows you to set an application password. After you set an application password, you must enter the password when you start Client ODC. If you enter the wrong password three times, the system will prompt you to reset the data. If you reset the data, connection information saved in ODC will be cleared. 


In the lower-left corner of the ODC homepage, choose **Me** > **Application Password**. The **Set Application Password** dialog box appears.
