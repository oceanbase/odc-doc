Set an application password 
------------------------------------------------

You do not need to log on when you start the ODC client, because a default user is used. For security purposes, ODC client allows you to set an application password. After you set an application password, you must enter the password when you start the ODC client. If you enter the wrong password three times, the system will prompt you to reset the data. If you reset the data, connection information saved in ODC will be cleared. 

Click **Account** in the upper-right corner of the navigation bar on the ODC homepage. In the context menu that appears, click **Set Application Password** . Specify a password in the dialog box. You can delete and change the password.
