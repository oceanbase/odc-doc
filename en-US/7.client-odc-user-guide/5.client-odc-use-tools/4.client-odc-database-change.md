Asynchronous execution 
===========================================



Overview 
-----------------------------

Statements in the SQL window of OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) are executed synchronously. Therefore, the execution may time out when the statement runs for a long time. You can use the asynchronous execution tool to run time-consuming SQL statements to avoid execution timeout.

Procedure 
------------------------------

To use the asynchronous execution tool to execute SQL statements, perform the following steps:

1. Enter the **Asynchronous Execution** panel. 

   1. Log on to the ODC homepage, and click the name of the target connection to go to the corresponding database object management page.

      
   
   2. Click **Tool** in the top navigation bar.

      
   
   3. Select **Asynchronous Execution** in the drop-down list. The **Create Async Task** panel appears

      
   

   

2. Specify the task name. 

   Specify the task name in the **Task Name** field in the panel. The task name must be unique and must not exceed 110 characters in length.
   

3. Specify **SQL Content** . 

   The asynchronous execution tool provides two ways to specify SQL content:
   * **SQL Entry** : This is the default way to specify SQL content. You can directly write the SQL script in the editing area. 

     **Note**

     
     * The maximum size of the SQL statements that can be entered in the SQL window is limited to 500,000 characters. If the SQL script to be executed has more than 500,000 characters, you can upload it in the form of a \*.sql file.

       
     
     * Click **IN Value Conversion** to convert batch copied and pasted data into the in('A','B') format. 

       * Column values are separated with line breaks.

         
       
       * Row values are separated with spaces or tabs.

         
       

       
     

     
     
   
   * **Upload File** : Click the file pool to go to the file explorer and select the file to be imported. You can also directly drag the file to the file pool to upload it. The file size cannot exceed 20 MB and only SQL files suffixed with .sql are supported.

     
   

   

4. Specify the delimiter.

   

5. Specify the query result limit. Value range: 1 to 1000000.

   

6. Specify **Task Error Handling Method** . 

   The asynchronous execution tool provides two methods to handle task errors:
   * **Abort Task** : This is the default option. When you select this option, the task is aborted if an error occurs when you run the script.

     
   
   * **Ignore Error and Continue** : When you select this option, the system skips the statement where an error occurs and continues to execute other statements in the script.

     
   

   

7. Specify **Execution Timeout Value** . 

   Specify the value in the **Execution Timeout Value** field in hours. Default value: 48. Maximum value: 480.
   

8. Optional. Specify the task description. 

   You can enter a description of no more than 200 characters in **Task Description** .
   

9. Create the asynchronous task. 

   After you specify the above information in the panel, click **Create** to submit the information to create the asynchronous execution task.
   

10. After the task is created, ODC will direct you to the **Asynchronous Execution** page of the task center. On the Task Details page, you can click **View** to view the **Task Information** and **Task Logs** .
