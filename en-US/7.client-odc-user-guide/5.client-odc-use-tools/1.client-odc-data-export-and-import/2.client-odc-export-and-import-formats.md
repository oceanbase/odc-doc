Export and import formats 
==============================================

OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) supports three data export modes: Export Schema and Data, Export Data Only, and Export Schema Only. A schema is the DDL file of an exported object, while data is the data file stored in the object. The types of schemas and data files vary with the export and import formats. 

ODC supports exporting data in CSV and SQL formats and importing ZIP, SQL (batch import), and CSV (single table import) files. 

Export file formats 
----------------------------------------

ODC exports data in a zip file, which contains the metadata file MANIFEST.bin, the schema definition files of the exported objects, and the data files. 

When you create an export task, if you set **Data Format** to **SQL Format** , the zip file contains the schema definition files named in the pattern of `object_name-schema.sql` and data files named in the pattern of `object_name.sql`. The object names are the same as those of the objects in the database.

If you set **Data Format** to **CSV Format** , the zip file contains the schema definition files named in the pattern of `object name-schema.sql` and data files named in the pattern of `object name.csv`. The object names are the same as those of the objects in the database.

Import file formats 
----------------------------------------

ODC supports importing ZIP (batch import and single table import), SQL (batch import), and CSV (single table import) files. 

The ZIP file here is a compressed package that is suffixed with .zip. When you create an import task, if you select **ZIP Files** as the **Import Content** , you must specify whether **Data Format** in the zip file is **CSV Format** or **SQL Format** . For more information about the content of different formats of files to be exported, see **Export file formats**. 

SQL files supported for batch data import are suffixed with .sql and contain statements that can be directly executed in the database. These statements include `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `CREATE`, and `DROP`. 

CSV files supported for single table import are data files that are suffixed with .csv or .txt. These files support custom delimiters.
