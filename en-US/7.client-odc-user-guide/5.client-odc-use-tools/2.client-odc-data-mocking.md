Data mocking 
=================================
#docslug#oceanbase-developer-center/odc/V3.3.1/client-odc-data-mocking
OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) provides the data mocking feature. This feature can generate data based on field types in a table, to meet your requirement for a large amount of data during database performance tests or feature verification.

Perform the following steps to generate data by using the data mocking feature:

1. Go to the **Mock Data** panel. 

   Log on to ODC, and click the name of the target connection to go to the corresponding database object management page. Click **Tool** in the navigation bar in the upper part of the page and select **Mock Data** from the drop-down list. The **Mock Data** panel appears.
   

2. Specify the table for generating data. 

   In the Mock Data panel, select the table from the drop-down list under **Table** . The drop-down list displays all the tables in the current instance.
   

3. Specify the task name. 

   By default, the data mocking task is named in the format of \< **Connection name\>_\<Mode name\>_\<Object name\>_\<Timestamp\>** . After you select the table to store the generated data, the task name is automatically generated in the field under **Task Name** . You can modify the task name.
   

4. Specify the amount of data to be generated. 

   In the Mock Data panel, set **Mock Data Volume** to specify the desired number of data rows to be generated. The default value is 1000. The system can generate up to 100,000 rows of data. You can set the value to an integer between 1 and 100000.
   

5. Specify the batch size. 

   In the Mock Data panel, set **Batch Processing Size** to specify the number of rows generated that trigger a `COMMIT` operation. The default value is 200. That is, a commit operation is performed once every 200 rows are generated. The maximum value supported is 500. You can set the value to an integer between 1 and 500.
   

6. Specify whether to empty the table before inserting mock data into it. 

   In the Mock Data panel, select Yes or No under **Empty Table Before Inserting Mock Data** to specify whether or not to empty the table before inserting mock data.
   

7. Specify the data conflict handling mode. 

   In the Mock Data panel, specify **Data Conflict Handling Mode** by selecting a mode from the drop-down list. ODC supports the following methods:
   * **Ignore** : This option is selected by default. The data conflicting with existing data is not inserted.

     
   
   * **Overwrite** : If a data conflict occurs, the original data is deleted, and the new data is inserted.

     
   
   * **Terminate** : If a data conflict occurs, the data mocking task is terminated.

     
   

   

8. Set data generation rules. 

   In the Mock Data panel, the **Rule Settings** table displays the fields in the table you selected in Step 2 in the **Field Name** and **Field Type** columns. You can specify the data generation rules for the target fields in the **Rule** and **Rule Details** columns. The **Rule** column provides built-in rules based on the field type for you to choose from. The **Rule Details** column displays the detailed information for the rule that you selected. You can click the edit icon to edit the information.
   

9. Submit the information to generate a data mocking task. 

   Click the **Submit** button in the lower-right corner of the Mock Data panel to generate a data mocking task. You can view the task details in the **Task Center** page. For more information, see [Data mocking tasks](../8.client-odc-task-management/4.client-odc-data-mocking-tasks.md).
