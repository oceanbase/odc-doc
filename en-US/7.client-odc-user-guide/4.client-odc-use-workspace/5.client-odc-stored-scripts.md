If the script is an SQL script, ODC opens the script in an SQL window. If the script is an anonymous block script, ODC opens the script in an anonymous block window. In the script list, the following two buttons are provided after each script name:

* **Edit** : Click this button to go to the editing page where you can edit the script name and content. After you finish editing, click **OK** in the lower-right corner of the page to apply the modification.

  

* **Delete** : Click this button to delete the script.
