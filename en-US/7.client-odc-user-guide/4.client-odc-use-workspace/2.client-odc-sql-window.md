SQL window 
===============================



Overview 
-----------------------------

On the Database Management page of OceanBase Developer Center (ODC), click **Workspace** in the top navigation bar and click **SQL Window** in the drop-down menu that appears. 

The SQL window provides an SQL editing area for editing scripts, an execution record tab, and a result tab for displaying the execution results. The SQL window also supports executing PL/SQL statements.

SQL editing area 
-------------------------------------

The SQL editing area provides many features for you.


|                        Feature                        |                                                                                                            Description                                                                                                             |

| Auto-complete                                         | The SQL editing area provides the auto-complete feature to improve your SQL statement editing efficiency.  For example, when you edit SQL statements, the table name is auto-completed for cross-database queries. |
| Intelligent identification of keywords and code       | Database keywords are highlighted in different colors, and PL/SQL statements are identified.                                                                                                                                       |
| Right-click of object names in the `SELECT` statement | When you right-click the name of a table, view, or function in a `SELECT` statement, some common operations are displayed. When you place the pointer over the name of a table, the field information is displayed.                |
| Object drag-and-drop                                  | You can directly drag objects from the object list into an SQL statement in the SQL editing area to fill in an object name in a statement.                                                                                         |
| Identification of special symbols                     | Special symbol abnormality can be identified in the editing area of the SQL window. The abnormal symbols are marked with yellow wavy underlines.                                                                                   |


**Note**



* In ODC, connections to the same database share the same session. The auto-commit feature of ODC in Oracle mode is enabled by default. If you want to manually commit transactions, you can modify the value of the **autocommit** variable on the **Session Properties** page. For more information, see [Session management](../9.client-odc-session-management.md).

  

* In manual-commit mode, make sure to set `ob_trx_idle_timeout` to a value greater than the timeout value of SQL queries. Otherwise, if two SQL statements in one transaction are executed at an interval longer than the value of `ob_trx_idle_timeout`, the connection will be terminated. However, if the `ob_trx_idle_timeout` parameter is set to an excessively large value, the session cannot be released in time, resulting in unnecessary memory consumption. Therefore, you must set this parameter to a proper value.

  




In addition to the preceding features, the toolbar of the editing area provides the following buttons.

| Run                   | Click this button to execute all the SQL statements in the current window. This button is disabled if an SQL statement is being executed in another window of the same session.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Run Current Statement | Click this button to execute all the selected SQL statements or the SQL statement in the line where the pointer is located. This button is disabled if an SQL statement is being executed in another window of the same session.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Commit                | Auto-commit is turned off by default in Oracle mode, so you need to click this button to commit the current transaction. After you click this button, a dialog box appears, indicating that the current connection uses a shared session and the commit will apply to all windows. Click **Yes** to commit the transaction. In MySQL mode, auto commit is turned on by default, so this button is not displayed. This button is disabled if an SQL statement is being executed in another window of the same session. |
| Abort                 | Click this button to abort the statement that is being executed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Format                | Click this button to apply the formatting, such as indentation, line break, and keyword highlighting, to the selected SQL statements or all the SQL statements in the current SQL window.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| IN Value Conversion   | Click this button to convert the copied rows or columns into the specified format during queries. After you paste the copied data to the SQL editing area, select the copied data and click **IN Value Conversion** to convert it into the in('A','B') format. * Column values are separated with line breaks.   * Row values are separated with spaces or tabs.                                                                   |
| Setting               | * **Delimiter** : Select the sign that you want to use as the delimiter from the drop-down list. Five types of delimiters are supported: semi-colons ( **;** ), slashes ( **/** ), double slashes ( **//** ), dollar signs ( **$** ), and double dollar signs ( **$$** ).   * **Query Result Limit** : allows you to set the maximum number of lines that a query can return. Default value: 1000.                                 |
| Save                  | Click this button to save the script in the current window. You can open a saved script when you enter the workspace again. You can view only the SQL scripts saved by yourself. The script names must be unique. After you open a saved script, you can continue to edit it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Execution Plan        | Click this button to view the execution plan for the SQL statement that you select or on which the pointer is located. This execution plan is estimated by the system before execution and is the result of the EXPLAINPLAN operation. Therefore, the execution data displayed may differ from the actual execution data. You can use this feature to evaluate SQL statements.  Click **Execution Plan** . In the **Plan Details** tab, click **View Formatting Info** to go to the format page.      |
| Snippet               | Click this button to view and reference built-in and custom code snippets. For more information, see [Snippet](../4.client-odc-use-workspace/6.client-odc-snippet.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |



Execute a PL statement 
-------------------------------------------

You can edit a PL/SQL statement in the SQL window. Note that you must end the PL/SQL statement with the specified delimiter. 

At present, you can use the following methods to specify a delimiter in ODC:

* Click **Settings** in the toolbar of the SQL editing area. In the window that appears, select the required delimiter in the **Delimiter** field.

  

* On the **Personal Settings** page, select a required delimiter in **Delimiter Settings** . 

  **Notice**

  
  * In ODC V2.4.1 and later, you can use the `DELIMITER` statement in the editing area to define a delimiter. In **Settings** , the **Delimiter** field displays the delimiter that you specified.

    
  
  * You can directly use forward slashes (/) to separate PL/SQL statements. However, if a PL/SQL statement contains any forward slashes, you still need to set a custom delimiter.

    
  

  
  




After you execute the PL/SQL statement in the SQL window, the result tab displays the database management system (DBMS) output.

| Edit           | Click **Edit** to enable editing mode for the current result set. The editing mode supports the following operations: **Add** , **Copy Current Row** , **Delete** , **Cancel** , **Confirm Modification** , which submits a transaction when auto-commit is turned on, and **Modify and Submit** , which is displayed when auto-commit is turned off. In the editing mode, you can either double-click target data to directly modify it or click the preceding buttons for convenient operations.  When you edit a cell, you can right-click the cell and select **Copy** or **Set to Null** from the context menu to operate on the cell.  **Note**  Based on the ResultMetaData obtained after the execution of SQL statements, you can determine whether a result set can be edited. * If the result set cannot be edited, the edit icon is hidden and a message is displayed indicating that the result set cannot be edited.   * Otherwise, you can click the edit icon, and edit the result set on the editing page.
