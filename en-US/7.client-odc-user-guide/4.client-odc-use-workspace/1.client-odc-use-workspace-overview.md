Overview 
=============================

The workspace is the main feature module for you to develop databases in OceanBase Developer Center (ODC). 

After you enter the corresponding database connection, you can click **Workspace** in the navigation bar on the top of the page. The drop-down list provides the following features:

* **SQL Window** : An SQL window is a working area for database developers to edit SQL and PL statements. ODC also provides the **Snippets** button in the SQL window.

  

* **Anonymous Block Window** : An anonymous block window is a working area for database developers to edit anonymous block scripts. (The anonymous block window is available only in Oracle mode. )

  

* **Command-line Window** : OceanBase command-line client OBClient is integrated in the form of a command-line window. It allows you to execute SQL or PL statements and view the execution results in real time.

  

* **Stored Scripts** : Database developers can open scripts previously stored in ODC.

  

* **Snippets** : View and reference built-in and custom code snippets
