Language switching 
---------------------------------------

You can find the display language of ODC in the upper-right corner of the ODC homepage. The default language is Simplified Chinese. You can click the language key to switch to another display language. ODC supports three display languages: English, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese.

Personal settings 
--------------------------------------

Log on to Client ODC, click **Account** in the upper-right corner of the top navigation bar. Select **Personal Settings** from the drop-down list that appears. The **Edit Personal Settings** panel appears.

The configurations take effect on the current connection. The priority of personal settings is lower than that of settings you configured for each connection. In addition, the personal settings are persisted.

Set an application password 
------------------------------------------------

You do not need to log on when you start Client ODC, because a default user is used. For security purposes, Client ODC allows you to set an application password. After you set an application password, you must enter the password when you start Client ODC. If you enter the wrong password three times, the system will prompt you to reset the data. If you reset the data, connection information saved in ODC will be cleared. 

Click **Account** in the upper-right corner of the navigation bar on the ODC homepage. In the context menu that appears, click **Set Application Password** . Specify a password in the dialog box. You can delete and change the password.
