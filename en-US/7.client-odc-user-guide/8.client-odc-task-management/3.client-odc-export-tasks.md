Export tasks 
=================================

After you create a batch or single table export task in OceanBase Developer Center (ODC), you can view the task in the task list on the **Import** tab of the **Task Center** page. 

On the management page of the database connection, click **Task** in the navigation bar on the top of the page to go to the Task Center page. Click **Export** to display the task list. 

> **Note**  
> ODC allows you to run up to three export tasks in parallel, while subsequent tasks wait in the queue.



Task list 
------------------------------

On the Export tab, the task list displays the tasks created in the recent 48 hours. The list displays the following information. You can filter and sort the tasks based on the information.

* Connection: the name of the database connection to which the task belongs.

  

* Task Name: the name of the task that you specified when you created the task.

  

* Creation Time: the date and time when the task was created.

  

* Task Status: the current status of the task. Valid values: **Running** , **Aborted** , **Completed** , and **Failed** . ODC provides different management actions for tasks in different states.

  

* Actions: This column provides task management options, such as **View** , **Download** , **Retry** , **Abort** , and **Delete** .

Create an import task 
------------------------------------------

1. In the task center panel that pops up, click **+** on the right side of **Export**, and a new export task panel will pop up.

2. Specify the export content
   
   ODC supports three export modes: **Export Schema and Data**, **Export Data Only**, and **Export Schema Only**. **Export Schema Only** exports the definition statements of the target object. You can select the export content from the **Export Content** drop-down list.

3. Select a database

   Select the database where the object to export resides. The name of the database connection to which the task belongs is also displayed.

4. Specify the export range

   You can select **Partial Export** or **Full Export**.

   * If you select **Partial Export**, you can select the objects you want to export in the **Select Objects** pane in the **Export Objects** section. You can use the search box to search for desired objects.

  
   * If you select **Full Export**, all objects in the database are exported.

5. Go to the Export Settings panel

   Click **Next: Export Settings** to specify the file export settings and the sys tenant account.


6. Go to the Data File Settings panel

   a. Specify Data Format.
      
      ODC supports exporting data to files in the CSV format and SQL format. If you specify **Export Schema Only** for **Export Content**, you can only export data to files in the SQL format. For more information about formats, see [Export and import formats](../5.client-odc-use-tools/1.client-odc-data-export-and-import/2.client-odc-export-and-import-formats.md).

    b. Specify File Encoding.  
       
       ODC supports the following encoding standards: **ASCII**, **ISO-8859-1**, **GB2312**, **GBK**, **GB18030**, **Unicode (UTF-8)**, **Unicode (UTF-16)**, **Unicode (UTF-32)**, and **BIG5**. You can select the encoding standard from the **File Encoding** drop-down list.

    c. Specify Data File Settings.  

       If you select **Export Schema Only** for **Export Content**, you do not need to configure the export data settings. You need to specify the following fields:
   
       * **Use Global Snapshot**: If you select this option, ODC exports the data in the latest global snapshot of the specified table to ensure global data consistency.



      * **Batch Commit Quantity (SQL Format)**: You can click **Advanced** next to **Export Data Settings** to specify this field. If you select **SQL Format** for **Data Format**, you can specify the number of rows to be committed during the export. When this number is reached, a `COMMIT` command is executed.



      * Specify information for the CSV format. 

7. Specify schema file settings

   Choose whether to select **Add DROP TABLE Statement before CREATE TABLE Statement**. If you select this option, a `DROP` statement is added before the corresponding `CREATE` statement of an object when the schema files of the object are exported.

8. Select an execution method

   Select **Execute immediately** or **Timed execution**.

9. Set up the sys tenant account

   a. Choose whether to select **Use sys Tenant Account to Accelerate Export Task**. If you select this option, specify **Account** and **Password**.



   b. After you specify the account and password, you can click the **Test Connection** button next to the password box to verify whether the account information is valid. By default, the account for the connection settings is automatically filled in. If the connection fails, we recommend that you change the password for this export.

   > **Notice**    
   > - The account and password of the sys tenant are the account and password of a user in a cluster tenant. Do not enter `@sys#cluster` in the **Account** field. The following figure shows an example.<br>![Sys Tenant Account Settings](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/400/%E5%AF%BC%E5%85%A5%E5%AF%BC%E5%87%BA%20sys%20%E7%A7%9F%E6%88%B7%E8%B4%A6%E5%8F%B7%E8%AE%BE%E7%BD%AE.png)
   > 
   > - If the account of the sys tenant is not configured, comments and indexes are not imported or exported.


10. Retain Current Configuration

    Check **Retain Current Configuration** to keep the current part of the data file and structure file configuration.

11. Generate an export task


    After you specify all preceding information, you can click **Export** in the lower-right corner of the panel to create an export task and export the backup file directly to a local directory.
