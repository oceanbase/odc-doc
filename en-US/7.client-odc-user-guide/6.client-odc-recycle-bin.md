Recycle bin 
================================
#docslug#oceanbase-developer-center/odc/V3.3.1/client-odc-recycle-bin
Log on to OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) and click the name of the target connection to go to the corresponding database object management page. Click **Recycle Bin** to go to the recycle bin page. 



The recycle bin temporarily stores deleted database objects and allows you to search for and restore the deleted objects. Technically, the recycle bin is a data dictionary table that stores the information about the database objects deleted by users. Deletion here refers to the `DROP` operation. Data that is deleted by the `DELETE` operation does not enter the recycle bin. Therefore, an object deleted by the `DROP` operation is not permanently deleted and still occupies storage space. You can use the `PURGE` operation or empty the recycle bin in ODC to release the space. 

The recycle bin page displays the following information, as shown in the following figure:



|  Information  |                                                               Description                                                               |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Original Name | The name of the deleted object specified by its creator.                                                                                |
| Object Name   | The name that ODC gives to the object. Unlike the original name, the object name is never repeated and can uniquely identify an object. |
| Object Type   | The type of the deleted object.                                                                                                         |
| Recycled At   | The timestamp of when the object was deleted. The timestamps help you track deleted objects with ease.                                  |
