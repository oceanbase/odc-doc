Create a sequence 
======================================

Log on to OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) and click the name of the target connection in Oracle mode to go to the corresponding connection management page. You can click **Sequence** in the left-side navigation pane to get a list of sequences. To create a sequence, click **+** in the upper-right corner of the sequence list or choose **Create \> Sequence** in the top navigation bar. Perform the following two steps to create a sequence:

1. Set **Basic Info** : You need to specify **Sequence Name** and **User** . The User parameter is automatically specified based on the current account.

   

2. Set columns. This step is optional. You need to specify the following parameters to set columns:

   

   |    Parameter    |                                                                                       Description                                                                                        |
   |-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | From            | Specifies the initial value of the sequence, which must not be less than the value of **Minimum Value** .                                                                                |
   | Increment       | Specifies the step size for the auto-increment of sequence values. The value can be a negative number.                                                                                   |
   | Minimum Value   | Specifies the minimum value that can be obtained by the sequence. The minimum value supported by the database is -1026.                                                                  |
   | Maximum Value   | Specifies the maximum value that can be obtained by the sequence. The maximum value supported by the database is 1027.                                                                   |
   | Cache Settings  | Specifies the cache size for the sequence. A proper cache size can improve the performance in obtaining sequence values. You can also set the value to **No Cache** .                    |
   | Whether to Sort | Specifies whether the sequence obtains values in an ordered manner. The performance of the sequence in obtaining values in an ordered manner is inferior to that in an unordered manner. |
   | Cyclic or Not   | Specifies whether to start from the minimum value again when the sequence value reaches the maximum value.                                                                               |

   

3. Click **Next: Verify SQL Statement** to go to the Create Sequence page.

4. An SQL script is pre-generated based on the information you specified. After the SQL script is verified, click **Create** in the upper-right corner to run the script and generate a sequence.
