Specify the basic information. 
---------------------------------------------------

This is Step 1. The **Basic Info** section contains the following parameters:

* **View Name** : specifies the name of the view.

  

* **Check Item** : specifies the constraints on the input data. OceanBase does not support this parameter. It is set to **None** by default.

  




After you specify all the basic information, click **OK** to complete this step. You can either click **Next: Verify SQL Statement** to go to Step 4 to **verify the SQL statement**, or proceed to Step 2 to select base tables.

Select base tables (Optional) 
--------------------------------------------------

After you specify the basic information, you can proceed to Step 2 to select base tables, or you can skip Step 2. 

In the **Select Base Tables** section, the list on the left displays, in the hierarchy of schema \> database \> table/view, the base tables that you can select. You can search for base tables in this list. Select tables or views in the base table list, and click the add icon (\>) next to the list to add the selected tables and views to the table operation area on the right. 

In the table operation area, you can perform the following operations on a selected base table.

* Set an alias: You can set an alias for a selected base table. Click **Alias** next to the table name in the table operation area and enter the alias. This operation is optional.

  

* Set association relationships: when two or more tables exist in the table operation area, you can define an association relationship between the tables. The default association is **JOIN** . You do not need to set an association relationship for the last table. Click the drop-down list icon next to Alias and select an association relationship. Supported options: **JOIN** , **INNER JOIN** , **LEFT JOIN** , **RIGHT JOIN** , **CROSS JOIN** , **FULL JOIN** , **UNION** , **UNION ALL** , **INTERSECT** , **MINUS** , **LEFT OUTER JOIN** , **RIGHT OUTER JOIN** , and **FULL OUTER JOIN** .

  

* Adjust the association order: You can drag the base tables in the table operation area to reorder them. When you drag a table to become the last table, the association relationships of this table are deleted.

  

*

  Delete a base table: You can click the delete icon next to a table in the table operation area to delete it from the table operation area. After you delete a table, its associations with the next table are also deleted.
  




After you select and configure the base tables, click **OK** to complete this step.

Select fields (Optional) 
---------------------------------------------

After you select the base tables, you can proceed to Step 3 to select fields. This step is unavailable if you have skipped Step 2. 

In the **Select Fields** section, the list on the left displays, in the hierarchy of schema \> database \> table/view, the fields in the base tables that you selected in Step 2. You can search for fields in this list. Select fields in the field list, and click the add icon (\>) next to the list to add the selected fields to the field operation area on the right. 

In the field operation area, you can perform the following operations on a selected field.

* Set an alias: You can set an alias for a selected field. Click **Alias** next to the field name in the field operation area and enter the alias. This operation is optional.

  

* Adjust the association order: You can drag the fields in the field operation area to reorder them.

  

* Delete a field: You can click the delete icon next to a field in the field operation area to delete it from the operation area.

  

* Customize fields: Click **+** **Custom** in the upper-right corner of the field operation area to add a field to the operation area. You must specify a name and an alias for the field.

  




After you select and configure the fields, click **OK** to complete this step.

Verify the SQL statement 
---------------------------------------------

After you complete all the previous steps, click **Next: Verify SQL Statement** to go to the statement editing page. 

On the statement editing page, a view definition statement is generated based on the information specified in the **Basic Info** , **Select Base Table** , and **Select Fields** sections. You may need to fill in missing information to complete the statement. After you complete the statement, click **Create** in the upper-right corner of the page to create the view. 

In addition, the toolbar on the editing page provides the following buttons:
