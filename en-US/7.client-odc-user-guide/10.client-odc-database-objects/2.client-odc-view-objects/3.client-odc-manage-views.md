You can click the expand icon before the name of the target view in the view list, and the structure tree of the view is displayed in a drop-down list, as shown in the following figure. The structure tree of a view can have up to three levels. When you right-click an item in the tree, the shortcut menu displays some actions that you can perform on the item. For more information about these actions, see the **Management actions** section, where you can find the table describing the management options.
