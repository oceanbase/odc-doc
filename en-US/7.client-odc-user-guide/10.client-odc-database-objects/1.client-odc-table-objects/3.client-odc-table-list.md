Overview 
-----------------------------

Log on to OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) and click the name of the target connection to go to the corresponding connection management page. You can click **Table** in the left-side navigation pane to get a list of tables. 

The table list displays the table objects in the current database. In the table list, you can view the **structure tree** of an object. You can also right-click the target object to perform some **management actions** on the object.

Structure tree 
-----------------------

You can click the expand icon before the name of the target table in the table list, and the structure tree of the table is displayed in a drop-down list, as shown in the following figure. The structure tree of a table can have up to three levels. When you right-click an item in the tree, the shortcut menu displays some actions that you can perform on the item. For more information about these actions, see the **[Management actions](#management-actions)** section. In this section, you can find the table describing the management options.
