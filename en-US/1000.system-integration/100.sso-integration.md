# SSO integration

## Background information

Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication method that allows a user to use only a set of credentials to get securely authenticated for logging on to OceanBase Developer Center (ODC).

You can configure OAuth2- or OIDC-based SSO for ODC.

## Concepts

- Open Authorization (OAuth) is an open standard authorization protocol that allows users to authorize third-party applications to access their protected information stored on resource services without providing the username or password to the third-party applications. This decouples authentication from authorization. OAuth is a widely recognized and used international standard. OAuth 2.0 is an extension to OAuth 1.0. It is more secure and easier to implement. However, it is incompatible with OAuth 1.0. In other words, OAuth 2.0 deprecates OAuth 1.0.  OAuth defines a secure, open, and simple standard for the authorization of user resources. It allows third-party application systems to obtain user authorization information without getting the user account and password.

   - OAuth 2.0 is a delegated authorization framework used for REST/APIs.

   - OAuth 2.0 is a token-based authorization protocol that grants applications limited access to user data without disclosing the user password.

   - OAuth 2.0 decouples authentication from authorization.

- OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an authentication protocol that allows third-party applications to connect to an identity provider to obtain user information and returns the information to third-party applications in a secure and reliable manner. OIDC extends the OAuth 2.0 framework to provide basic user identity information by using extended ID token fields. OIDC uses JSON web tokens (JWTs) to encapsulate ID tokens, providing a self-contained and tamper-proof mechanism. This mechanism secures the transmission of user identity information to third-party applications for verification.

## Principle

### OAuth2

ODC is compatible with the standard OAuth2 authentication protocol. Currently, ODC supports only the authorization-code mode, in which an application uses an authorization code to apply for or update an access token from the authorization server.

As shown in the figure, the authorization process involves the following steps:

1. The user sends a logon request to the application system. The request is redirected to the authentication server. The user receives a 302 status code and returns to the logon authentication page.
2. The user enters the account and password for authentication. The authentication server verifies the information and returns an authorization code to the application system.
3. The application system exchanges the authorization code with the authentication server for an access token. The authentication server verifies information such as the client ID and authorization code and sends the access token to the application system.
4. The application system queries the user logon information by using the access token. The authentication server returns the user information, such as the user name.
5. The application system verifies the correctness of the username, creates a session, and redirects to the redirect URL.

The following table describes the parameters in the preceding process.

| **Step** | **Parameter description** |
| ------ | ------ |
| Step 1 | Authorization Request <ul><li> response_type: Required. The value is fixed to `code`. </li><li> client_id: Required. The third-party application ID. </li><li> state: Recommended. A string provided by the client. The server will return the exact string to the client. </li><li> redirect_uri: Required. The redirect URL used upon successful authorization. <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>This parameter specifies the redirect URL used by the authorization server to call back the ODC service. If an SSO callback allowlist is configured, add the redirect URL to the allowlist. </p></main></li><li> scope: Optional. The authorization scope. </li></ul> |
| Step 2 | Verify the parameters passed in step 1. <br>Display the login page for the user to authenticate. <br>The user grants authorization for resources to the client.  |
| Step 3 | Authorization Response <br>The server redirects to the redirect URL specified in Step 1 and returns:<ul><li> code: The authorization code. </li><li> state: The exact `state` string provided by the client in Step 1. </li></ul> |
| Step 4 | Access Token Request <ul><li> grant_type: Required. The value is fixed to `authorization_code`. </li><li> code: Required. The code returned in Authorization Response. </li><li> redirect_uri: Required. It must be the same as the redirect URL provided in Authorization Request. </li><li> client_id: Required. It must be the same as the client ID provided in Authorization Request. </li></ul> |
| Step 5 | Access Token Response <ul><li> access_token: The access token. </li><li> Refresh_token: The refresh token. </li><li> Expires_in: The time when the token expires. </li></ul> |

1. The client sends an authentication request to the authentication server.

2. The user consents to grant the authorization on the authentication page by logging in with the user name and password.

3. The authentication server verifies the authentication request and returns an authorization code to the client.

4. The client requests the callback API from the business server. The request carries the code.

5. The business server requests the authentication server to issue a token. The request contains the code, client ID, and client secret.

6. The authentication server verifies the validity and returns the ID token.

7. If the authentication succeeds, the business server returns an ID token to the client.

8. The client sends a request to the business server. The request carries the ID token.

9. The business service verifies whether the ID token is valid, and then returns a business response.

## Prerequisites

- You have the permissions to perform system integration operations.

- You have deployed the authorization service.

## Create an SSO integration configuration

### Configure OAUTH2-based SSO

Configure SSO of the OAUTH type to integrate Apereo Central Authentication Service (CAS) into ODC to authorize access to ODC with a CAS account.

1. Log on to web ODC. In the project collaboration window, choose **External Integration** > **SSO Integration** > **Create SSO Integration**.


2. On the **Create SSO Integration** page, configure the gateway authentication parameters.

   The following table describes the parameters for the OAUTH type.

   | **Parameter** | **Description** |
   | ------ | ------ |
   | Config Name | The configuration name that will be applied to the custom login.  |
   | Type | Select **OAUTH**.  |
   | Client ID | The application identifier, which is consistent with the ID specified for the authorization server during registration.  |
   | Auth URL | The grant-code URL provided by the authorization server.  |
   | User Info URL | The user-info URL provided by the authorization server.  |

5. After the connection test succeeds, the structure of the user information API is returned. Specify the parameters for user field mapping based on the returned information.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
      <h4>Note</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>The structure returned by the user information API may vary with the third-party application. To map user information from a third-party application to ODC, you must fill in the user information mapping table. User field mapping identifies ODC accounts associated with OAuth2 login. </li>
      <li>You can select the parameter names from the returned connection information and specify <strong>Username Field</strong> and <strong>Nickname Field</strong>. </li>
      <li>You can also enter custom fields and customize field mapping rules. </li>
      <li>The system administrator can configure custom field names on the <a href="../1000.user-permission-and-management/2.manage-automatic-authorization-rules.md">Automatic Authorization</a> page. When a user logs on to ODC by using a custom field, the user is automatically granted the role or permission. </li>
      </ul>
   </main>

6. Click **Save** to create the SSO integration.

7. In the SSO integration list, enable the created SSO integration.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
