# SSO integration

## Background information

Single sign-on (SSO) is an identity authentication method, which allows you to securely get authenticated in OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) by using a group of credentials.

You can configure Open Authorization (OAuth) 2.0 or OpenID Connect (OIDC) for logging on to ODC through SSO.

## Concepts

- OAuth is an open standard authorization protocol that allows users to authorize third-party applications to access their protected information stored on resource services without providing the username or password to the third-party applications. This decouples authentication from authorization. OAuth is a widely recognized and used international standard. OAuth 2.0 is an extension to OAuth 1.0. It is more secure and easier to implement. However, it is incompatible with OAuth 1.0. In other words, OAuth 2.0 deprecates OAuth 1.0.  OAuth defines a secure, open, and simple standard for authorizing user resources. A third party can obtain the authorization information of users without the need to obtain the user account and password.

   - OAuth 2.0 is a delegated authorization framework used for REST/APIs.

   - OAuth 2.0 is a token-based authorization protocol that grants applications limited access to user data without disclosing the user password.

   - OAuth 2.0 decouples authentication from authorization.

- OIDC is a security authentication mechanism. A third-party application connects to the identity provider to request user information and the identity provider returns the information to the application in a secure and reliable manner. OIDC extends the OAuth 2.0 protocol. The ID Token field is added to provide basic user identity information. The ID Token field is encapsulated in the JSON Web Token (JWT) format. An ID token encapsulated in the JWT format is self-contained and provides a tamper-proof mechanism. Therefore, it can be securely transferred to a third-party application and easily verified.

## Technical mechanism

### OAuth 2.0

OCP adapts to the OAuth 2.0 authentication center and supports only the authorization-code mode. In this mode, applications use an authorization code to request an access token or refresh token from the authorization server.

As shown in the preceding figure, the authorization process comprises the following steps:

1. The user logs on to the application system. The request is forwarded to the authentication server. Then, the logon authentication page appears, with the status code 302 returned.
2. The user enters the account and password for authentication. After authentication, the authentication server returns an authorization code to the application system.
3. The application system sends a request carrying the code to the authentication server to request for an access token. The authentication server verifies the client ID and code and returns an access token to the application system.
4. The application system uses the access token to query the user logon information. The authentication server returns the user information, such as the username.
5. The application system verifies the username, creates a session, and jumps to the redirection URL.

The following table describes the parameters involved in different steps.

| **Step** | **Parameter** |
| ------ | ------ |
| 1 | `Authorization Request` <ul><li> `response_type`: Required. The value is fixed to `code`. </li><li> `client_id`: Required. The ID of the third-party application. </li><li> `state`: Recommended. A string provided by the client. The server will return this string back to the client. </li><li> `redirect_uri`: Required. The redirection URL after authorization. <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>The authorization server calls back the URL of ODC. If the SSO system has a callback allowlist, you must add the URL of ODC to this allowlist. </p></main></li><li> `scope`: Optional. The authorization scope. </li></ul> |
| 2 | Parameters passed in Step 1 are verified. <br>The logon authentication page appears. <br>The user specifies the resources accessible to the client.  |
| 3 | `Authorization Response` <br>The authorization server jumps to the redirection URL specified in Step 1 and returns the following information:<ul><li> `code`: the authorization code. </li><li> `state`: the state parameter provided by the client in Step 1. </li></ul> |
| 4 | `Access Token Request` <ul><li> `grant_type`: Required. The value is fixed to `authorization_code`. </li><li> `code`: Required. The response code in `Authorization Response`. </li><li> `redirect_uri`: Required. The value must be the same as the redirection URL provided in `Authorization Request`. </li><li> `client_id: required. The value must be the same as the client ID provided in Authorization Request. </li></ul> |
| 5 | `Access Token Response` <ul><li> `access_token`: the access token. </li><li> `Refresh_token`: the refresh token. </li><li> `Expires_in`: the expiration time. </li></ul> |

### OIDC

![2](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/420/1000.system-integration/100.sso-integration/2EN.png)

1. The client sends an authentication request to the authentication service.

2. The user logs on by using the username and password on the authentication page to confirm authorization.

3. The authentication service verifies the authentication request and returns a code to the client.

4. The client requests a callback API from the business service, carrying the code in the request.

5. The business service requests a token from the authentication service, carrying the code, client ID, and client secret in the request.

6. The authentication service verifies the information carried in the request and returns an ID token to the business service.

7. After authentication, the business service returns the ID token to the client.

8. The client initiates a business request, carrying the ID token in the request.

9. The business service verifies the ID token and returns a response to the client.

## Prerequisites

- You have the system integration permission.

- You have deployed the authorization service.

## Considerations

- Only the authorization-code mode is supported.

- When you log off, only the logon state in ODC is cleared, and the logon state in the SSO system is not cleared.

- The name of a mapped column must be of the String type.

## Create an SSO integration task

### Configure SSO based on OAuth 2.0

Example: Use OAuth to integrate Apereo Central Authentication Service (CAS) to ODC so that you can access ODC by using a CAS account.

1. Log on to Web ODC. In the project collaboration window, choose **External Integration** > **SSO Integration** > **Create SSO Integration Task**.
