# Approval integration

## Background information

ODC V4.2.0 has built-in approval processes that implement database security control in team collaboration scenarios. Each approval process has a risk level. In ODC, operations that hit the same risk level trigger the same approval process.

ODC V4.2.0 allows system administrators and users with external integration management permissions to configure integration with external approval systems. When editing an approval process, you can add an approval node to reference an integrated external approval system. In this way, you can combine external approval nodes with the built-in ODC approval process.

This topic describes how to configure and manage approval integration.

## Execution process

![1](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/420/1000.system-integration/200.approval-integration/1EN.png)

1. The ODC system administrator or a user with external integration management permissions enables approval integration and configures request/response API information for access to external approval systems based on configuration templates provided by ODC, and creates an external approval integration configuration.

2. The ODC system administrator creates a task approval process and selects the external system integration node as an approval node.

3. The ODC system administrator edits a risk level and selects the created approval process.

4. An ODC member initiates a task ticket. If the approval role of the approval task process node is external system integration, ODC calls the API of the external approval system to create an approval process. The approval result is automatically synchronized to the ODC approval process.

## Configuration

### Configuration method

You can edit the YAML file online to configure approval integration. The YAML file allows you to configure the following information:

1. HTTP connection parameters

2. APIs for creating a process, querying process status, and terminating a process

3. Encryption parameters

The following table describes the fields supported by the YAML file.

| **Level-1 parameter** | **Level-2 parameter** | **Level-3 parameter** | **Level-4 parameter** | **Type** | **Default value** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                               |

2. In the **Create Approval Integration** panel, specify the following parameters.


   | Parameter | Description |
   |-------------|--------------|
   | Name | The name of the approval integration configuration.  |
   | Status | Specifies whether to enable the approval integration configuration.  |
   | Settings | Edit the YAML file online to configure approval integration. For more information, see **Configuration**.  |

3. Click **Save**. The approval integration configuration is created.
