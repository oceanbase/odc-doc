## Background information

After the project administrator creates a project member, the project member can create a data source and add a database in the data source to the project to perform database change tasks.

1. The system administrator creates a project in Web OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) and assigns members to the project.

2. The system administrator or a project member with the data source creation permission creates a data source.

3. The project DBA or project owner adds a database in the data source to the project.

4. A project member creates a database change task.

5. When the project member initiates a task ticket, an approval process is automatically selected based on the risk level and identification rules.

6. The approval roles on the corresponding approval process nodes review the task process.

7. The database change task is executed after it is approved.

| ![Search](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/icon/search.jpg) | Search for the target data source.  |
| ![filter](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/icon/filter.jpg) | Filter data sources by type.  |
| ![sort](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/icon/sort.png) | Sort data sources.  |

If a database connected to a data source no longer exists or is no longer required, you can delete the current connection configuration.

To delete the current connection configuration, click **Delete** in the **Actions** column of the target data source.
