# Session management

This topic provides information on querying sessions.

## Background information

A session is a connection between an application and a database. On the **Session Management** page of ODC, you can view details about all sessions of a database under the current data source. ODC provides a visual interface that allows you to query session variables supported by the current database on the **Session Management** page.


## Query sessions

Assume that you want to query all sessions of the `odc_test` database under the data source `mysql420` in the SQL development window.

| Parameter | Example |
| ------ | ------ |
| Data Source | mysql420 |
| Database Name | odc_test |

1. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **O&M Management** > **Session Management**.
