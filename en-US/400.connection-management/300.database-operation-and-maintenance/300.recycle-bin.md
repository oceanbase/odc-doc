# Recycle bin management

This topic provides information on managing the recycle bin.

## Background information

The recycle bin temporarily stores deleted database objects. ODC allows you to search for and recover the deleted database objects.

Technically, the recycle bin is a data dictionary table that stores the information about deleted database objects. Deletion here refers to the `DROP` operation. Data that is deleted by the `DELETE` operation will not be moved to the recycle bin. Therefore, an object deleted by the `DROP` operation is not permanently deleted and still occupies storage space. You can use the `PURGE` operation or empty the recycle bin in ODC to release the space.

## Query the recycle bin

Assume that you want to query the database objects under the data source `mysql420` in the SQL development window.

1. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **O&M Management** > **Recycle Bin**.

2. Select the data source `mysql420` and click **OK**.

3. On the **Recycle Bin** page, you can query all database objects deleted from the data source `mysql420`.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |---------|-------------|
   | Original Name | The name of the deleted object specified by its creator.  You can click Original Name to sort the objects by original name in ascending or descending order.  |
   | Object Name | The name that ODC gives to the object.  Unlike the original name, the object name is never repeated and can uniquely identify an object.  |
   | Object Type | The type of the deleted object.  |
   | Recycled At | The timestamp when the object was deleted. The timestamps help you track deleted objects with ease.  |


## Edit the recycle bin

Assume that you want to query the `ccc` table in the data source `mysql420` in the SQL development window.

| Parameter | Example |
| ------ | ------ |
| Data Source | mysql420 |
| Database Table | ccc |

1. In the recycle bin list, select the `ccc` table and click **Restore**.

2. On the **Restore Database Object** page, you can rename the object and click **Restore**.

   In addition, the navigation bar on the recycle bin page provides buttons with the following features.

   | Delete | Click ![Delete](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/6479168461/p412873.jpg) to purge the selected objects from the recycle bin and release the storage space.  |
   | Restore | Click ![Recover](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/7479168461/p412874.jpg) to recover the selected objects from the recycle bin to its original location.  |
   | Clear | Click ![Clear](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/7479168461/p412872.jpg) to clear the recycle bin so that all the deleted objects in the recycle bin are purged and the storage space is released.  |
   | Search | Enter the name of a deleted object in the search field to search for it.  |
   | Settings | Click ![Settings](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/7479168461/p413502.jpg) to specify whether to enable the recycle bin and the Truncate Table feature.  <ul><li>If the recycle bin is enabled, the structure of deleted objects will be moved to the recycle bin.</li><li>If the Truncate Table feature is enabled, the data of deleted objects will be retained.</li></ul>  |
   | Refresh | Click ![Refresh](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/9525548461/p412817.jpg) to refresh the list of deleted objects in the recycle bin.  |
