# Create a data source

This topic introduces how to create a data source.

## Background information

You can connect ODC to an OceanBase database. After the connection is successfully established, you can edit and manage the connected data sources, including the database objects and resources, in ODC. ODC can connect to OceanBase Database in MySQL and Oracle modes on Apsara Stack and Alibaba Cloud.


## Prerequisites

- You have deployed [web ODC](../../1600.deployment-guide/1.deployment-overview.md).

- You have [logged on to web ODC](../2.web-odc-quickstart/2.quickstart-deployment-odc/2.quickstart-log-on-to-odc.md).

- You have obtained the connection information or connection string of the data source instance. A connection string is in the following format: `mysql -h <host name> -P <port number> -u <database username>@<tenant name> # <cluster name> -D <default database> -p '<database password>'`. Here is an example of a connection string:

   ```shell
   -hxxx.x.x.x -P8080 -uodc@mysql_tenant#odc_cluster -Dodc -p'******'
   ```

## Procedure

### Create a single data source

Assume that you want to create a data source in ODC for an OceanBase database in MySQL mode.

| Parameter | Example |
| -------- | -------- |
| Data Source Name | mysql4.2.0 |
| Host IP Address | xxx.x.x.x |
| Port | 8080 |
| Cluster Name | odc_cluster |
| Tenant Name | mysql_tenant |
| Database Username | odc |
| Database Password | ****** |
| sys Tenant Account | test |
| sys Tenant Password | ****** |


1. Log on to web ODC. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Data Sources** > **New Data Source**.

   ![1](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/420/quickstart/webodc/using%20odc/3-EN.png)

2. In the **New Data Source** panel, specify the following information.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p>If you already have the connection string of an OceanBase database, you can specify the following fields based on the connection string. You can also paste the connection string into the Intelligent Parsing field to populate the information in the corresponding fields. </p>
   </main>

   | Parameter | Description     |
   |--------------|--------------|
   | Data Source Type | **OceanBase** is selected by default.      |
   | Intelligent Parsing | You can paste a connection string into this field. ODC automatically identifies the string and fills in the corresponding fields.   |
   | Connection Type | The type of the database to be connected. ODC supports the following database types:<ul><li>OceanBase MySQL/OceanBase Oracle: a database instance deployed in your own environment. </li><li>OceanBase MySQL Cloud/OceanBase Oracle Cloud: a database instance deployed on Alibaba Cloud. </li><li>OceanBase MySQL Sharding: a logical database, which supports only the MySQL mode. </li></ul>   |
   | Endpoint | <ul><li> **Host IP**: the IP address of the server where the target database is located. </li><li> **Port**: the port number of the server where the target database is located. </li><li> **Cluster**: the name of the cluster where the target database is located. This parameter is not required for a logical database. </li><li> **Tenant**: the name of the tenant in which the target database is located. This parameter is not required for a logical database. </li></ul><blockquote> **Note**<br>You can obtain the host name and port number from the details page of the tenant in which the target database is located, such as a tenant created on Alibaba Cloud or in OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP). </blockquote>    |
   | Database Account | <ul><li> Account: the username of an account created in the tenant. In MySQL mode, this account must have the privilege to access the default database. </li><li> Password: the password of the account created in the tenant. You can click **Test Connection** next to the password field to test whether you can connect to the target database. </li></ul> <blockquote>  **Note** <ul><li> An error will be returned if the configurations such as the username, password, and network settings are invalid. </li><li> You can connect to only a database in the current tenant. Otherwise, an error is returned, indicating that the connection test fails. </li><li>Before you save the configuration, you can click <strong>Test Connection</strong> to test the database connection. If the username and password are correct, the message <a href="">Connected</a> is displayed. If you use ODC V4.0.0 and later, you can save the connection without setting the database account and password. </li></ul></blockquote>     |
   | Environment | The type of the environment. Valid values: `dev`, `sit`, `prod`, and `default`.   |
   | Sys Tenant Account Settings | Choose whether to select **Query Tenant Views with sys Tenant Account**. If you select this option, specify **Account** and **Password**. <br>When the database is a physical database, you can specify an account that has the privilege to query the sys tenant views and the password. This field is automatically filled in when sys is specified as the tenant in **Endpoint**. <ul><li> **Account**: an account that has the privilege to check the views under the sys tenant. </li><li> **Password**: the password of the account. </li></ul>    After you specify the account and password, you can click **Test Connection** next to the password field to verify whether the account information is valid. <blockquote> **Note** <ul><li> In ODC V2.3.0 and later versions, to use the import and export features, you need to configure the root@sys account in the Advanced Configuration section during connection creation. </li><li> In ODC V2.4.1 and later versions, the dependency of the import and export features on the root@sys user is removed when you query views. If the root@sys account is not configured, some ODC objects such as stored procedures and functions do not support the export feature. If the root@sys account is configured, you can access the views under the sys tenant to obtain the optimal data routing strategy, which can increase the export speed. </li><li>  The **account and password of the sys tenant** are the account and password of a user in the cluster. Do not enter @sys#cluster in the **Account** field. For example, the account of the root@sys user is root.  </li></ul></blockquote>       |
   | Enable SSL | Specifies whether to enable SSL link encryption to ensure secure data transmission between clients and servers. <blockquote>**Note**</br><ul><li>By default, the `REQUIRE NONE` option is specified when you create a user. The `REQUIRE NONE` option specifies that no encryption method is used. In this case, if you select **Enable SSL**, an SSL connection is created. Otherwise, a regular connection is created. </li><li>If the `REQUIRE SSL` option is specified when you create the user, you must select **Enable SSL** to create an SSL connection. Otherwise, the connection fails. <br>If the user is created by specifying the `REQUIRE SSL` option, you do not need to upload the certificates, but you must select **Enable SSL**. Otherwise, the connection fails. We recommend that you upload the following certificates for identity verification:<ol><li>CA certificate. The client will verify the identity of the server.</li><li>Client key and client certificate. The server will verify the identity of the client. </li></ol></li><li>If the user is created by specifying the `REQUIRE X509` option, you must select **Enable SSL** and upload the CA certificate, the client key, and the client certificate. The client and the server will verify the identity of each other. If you do not select **Enable SSL** or upload the certificate, you cannot create the connection. </li></ul>Before you select **Enable SSL** in ODC, make sure that SSL is enabled for the OBServer. If you connect to the OBServer node by using an ODP, make sure that SSL is enabled for the ODP. For more information about how to enable SSL for an OBServer, see [Transmission encryption of OBServer nodes](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/enterprise-oceanbase-database-cn-10000000000944716) and [SSL link encryption](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/254643.html). </blockquote> |

      <h4>Note</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>In the lower-right corner of the <strong>New Data Source</strong> panel, click <strong>Copy Connection String</strong> to copy the current connection information as a connection string. This makes it easier to obtain the currently configured connection information. </li>
      <li>If you do not want to save the current connection information, click <strong>Cancel</strong>. Then, a confirmation dialog box appears, asking whether you want to exit the connection creation window. </li>
      </ul>
   </main>

5. After the data source is created, you can check it in the data source list.
