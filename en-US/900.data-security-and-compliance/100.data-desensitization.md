# Desensitize data

## Background information

Data desensitization deforms sensitive privacy information, such as names, ID card numbers, mobile numbers, landline numbers, bank accounts, and email addresses, by using desensitization algorithms to protect sensitive privacy data.

## Concepts

- Data desensitization: a feature that uses specific algorithms and techniques to process, obfuscate, or replace sensitive data during data processing and storage so that the data cannot be identified or restored, thereby protecting data security and preventing data breaches.

- Dynamic desensitization: a process of desensitizing sensitive data in real time when a user queries the database, without modifying the source data in the database. Generally, dynamic desensitization is used in a production environment. It avoids data breaches while ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the original data. However, dynamic desensitization is slow, which can compromise the query efficiency of the database.

- Static desensitization: a process of preprocessing sensitive data and storing the processed data in storage media, such as a database. Static desensitization is usually used in testing, development, and demonstration environments. It protects sensitive data from being viewed by unauthorized personnel and avoids the legal liability of data breaches. Static desensitization is quick, which can improve the query efficiency. However, after static desensitization, the original data cannot be restored, which undermines data accuracy.

- Desensitization algorithm: an algorithm used to desensitize sensitive data. A desensitization algorithm can effectively protect the security of sensitive data and avoid data breaches while retaining the data formats and structures to facilitate queries and usage.

- Identification rule: a rule used to automatically identify sensitive data for data desensitization. When you scan to add sensitive columns, sensitive columns are automatically identified based on specified rules.

- Sensitive column: a column that contains sensitive data in a database table.

## Execution process

![2.2](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odc/420/900.data-security-and-compliance/100.data-desensitization/2.2EN.png)

1. Log on to the ODC console as the project administrator and choose **Security Specifications** > **Masking Algorithm** to view the built-in desensitization algorithms and test the desensitization effect.

2. Log on to the ODC console as the project administrator and choose **Projects > Sensitive Columns**. You can click **Add Sensitive Column** and select **Add Manually** or **Scan to Add**. To select **Scan to Add**, make sure that identification rules have been created.

3. When you log on as a regular user and perform queries in the SQL window, export a result set, export a ticket, or submit a database change ticket, the output data in the sensitive columns is desensitized.

## Prerequisites

- The project administrator or DBA can manage sensitive columns and identification rules.

- All users can view and test the desensitization effect, but regular users are not allowed to create, edit, or delete desensitization algorithms.

## Considerations

- Data desensitization is not supported in command-line windows.

- Data desensitization is not supported during PL execution.

- When you configure an identification rule script, Groovy supports only the Objects and String classes in Java.

- When you configure an identification rule script, Groovy closures and inherent closure functions are not supported.

- If sensitive data is involved when you export data from a MySQL data source, the mask all algorithm is used for desensitization.

## Sensitive column management

### Add sensitive columns

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
   <h4>Note</h4>
   <p>In ODC V4.2.2 and later, you can add sensitive columns for a MySQL data source. For the limitations on features of MySQL data sources, see <a href="../200.odc-overview/500.product-limits.md">Limitations</a>. </p>
</main>

Example: Desensitize the `email` and `mobile_phone` columns of the `student` table in the `odc_test` database.

| Parameter | Example value |
| ------ | ------ |
| Data source | mysql_4.2.0 |
| Source database name | odc_test |
| Table name | student |

1. In the project collaboration window, choose **Projects** > **Sensitive Columns**. You can click **Add Sensitive Column** and select **Add Manually** or **Scan to Add**.

## Identification rule management

Identification rules are an extension of the sensitive data management capability. In addition to manually adding sensitive columns, you can also specify identification rules to implement automatic scan of sensitive columns. An identification rule defines the matching conditions. ODC will identify the columns that meet the specified conditions as sensitive columns. ODC supports three identification methods for identification rules: path, regular expression, and script.

- Path: An identification rule based on a path expression identifies a sensitive column based on its database name, table name, or column name. The database name, table name, and column name are separated with periods (.). Matching conditions are separated with commas (,). Asterisks (*) are used as wildcard characters.

   | Parameter | Required? | Description |
   | ------ | ------ |------|
   | Rule Name | Yes | The name of the identification rule, which cannot exceed 64 characters in length.  |
   | Rule Status | Yes | The status of the identification rule. Valid values: **Enable** and **Disable**.  |
   | Matching Rule | Yes | Conditions for matching sensitive columns. Columns that meet the conditions specified here are identified as sensitive columns. <br>For example, the identification rule `\*\.\*\.mobile_phone` specifies to match columns named `mobile_phone` in any tables and databases.  |
   | Exclusion Rule | No | Conditions for excluding data columns. <main id="notice" type='notice'><h4>Notice</h4><p>The system determines whether a data column is a sensitive column based on the exclusion conditions first and then the matching conditions. </p></main> |
   | Masking Algorithm | Yes | The default desensitization algorithm for identified sensitive columns.  |
   | Rule Description | No | The description of the identification rule.  |

- Regular expression: An identification rule based on a regular expression identifies a sensitive column based on its database name, table name, column name, or column remarks.

   | Parameter | Required? | Description |
   | ------ | ------ |------|
   | Rule Name | Yes | The name of the identification rule, which cannot exceed 64 characters in length.  |
   | Rule Status | Yes | The status of the identification rule. Valid values: **Enable** and **Disable**.  |
   | Identification Object-Database Name | No | The regular expression for matching database names. <br>For example, `*` indicates databases with any names.  |
   | Identification Object-Table Name | No | The regular expression for matching table names. <br>For example, `e[a-z]?.*` indicates tables whose names are in lowercase and start with the letter e.  |
   | Identification Object-Column Name | No | The regular expression for matching column names.  |
   | Identification Object-Column Remarks | No | The regular expression for matching column remarks.  |
   | Masking Algorithm | Yes | The default desensitization algorithm for identified sensitive columns.  |
   | Rule Description | No | The description of the identification rule.  |

- Script: An identification rule based on a Groovy script identifies a sensitive column based on its database name, table name, column name, column remarks, or data type.

    <main id="notice" type='notice'>
      <h4>Notice</h4>
      <p>The output of the script must be a Boolean value, namely <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. </p>
    </main>

   | Parameter | Required? | Description |
   | ------ | ------ |------|
   | Rule Name | Yes | The name of the identification rule, which cannot exceed 64 characters in length.  |
   | Rule Status | Yes | The status of the identification rule. Valid values: **Enable** and **Disable**.  |
   | Groovy Script | Yes | The script that determines whether a data column is a sensitive column. The script is written based on Groovy syntax specifications.  |
   | Masking Algorithm | No | The default desensitization algorithm for identified sensitive columns.  |
   | Rule Description | No | The description of the identification rule.  |

   ODC provides built-in column objects for you to reference in the Groovy script. The following table describes the attributes in a column object.

   | Attribute | Type | Description |
   | ------ | ------ |------|
   | schema | String | The name of the database to which the column belongs.  |
   | table | String | The name of the table to which the column belongs.  |
   | name | String | The name of the column.  |
   | comment | String | The comment on the column.  |
   | type | String | The data type of the column.  |

Here are several sample identification rules that use a script as the identification method:

- Address:

```
if (("varchar".equals(column.type) || "char".equals(column.type))) {
    if (column.name.indexOf("address") >= 0) {
        return true;
    }
    if (column.comment != null &&
            (column.comment.toLowerCase().indexOf("address") >= 0
                    || column.comment.indexOf("Address") >= 0
                    || column.comment.indexOf("Residence address") >= 0
                    || column.comment.indexOf("Location") >= 0)) {
        return true;
    }
}
return false;
```

- Mobile number:

```
if (column.name.length() == 11 && ("varchar".equals(column.type) || "char".equals(column.type))) {
    if (column.name.indexOf("phone") >= 0 || column.name.indexOf("mobile") >= 0) {
        return true;
    }
    if (column.comment != null &&
            (column.comment.toLowerCase().indexOf("phone") >= 0
                    || column.comment.indexOf("Phone number") >= 0
                    || column.comment.indexOf("mobile") >= 0
                    || column.comment.indexOf("Mobile number") >= 0)) {
        return true;
    }
}
return false;
```

- ID card number:

```
if (column.name.length() >= 15 && ("varchar".equals(column.type) || "char".equals(column.type))) {
    if (column.name.indexOf("id_number") >= 0 || column.name.indexOf("identity_card") >= 0) {
        return true;
    }
    if (column.comment != null &&
            (column.comment.toLowerCase().indexOf("identity card") >= 0
                    || column.comment.indexOf("ID card number") >= 0)) {
        return true;
    }
}
return false;
```
