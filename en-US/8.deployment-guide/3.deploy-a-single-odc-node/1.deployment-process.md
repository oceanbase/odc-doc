Deployment process 
=======================================

To deploy OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) on a single server, load and run the ODC image on the server to install ODC. 

When you log on to Web ODC in a browser over HTTP for the first time, you will receive a message indicating that the connection is not secure. To ensure access security, you can configure an SSL certificate and deploy the NGINX image on the single-node ODC server by referring to the procedure for the high-availability deployment mode.
