Deployment verification
============================================

After ODC is deployed, you can use the IP address and port number, for example, <http://IP:PORT> or <http://DOMAIN:PORT>, of the host (where the NGINX proxy resides) to access Web ODC in a browser.

After you log on to Web ODC, the homepage appears. If you are logging on to Web ODC for the first time, register an account and then log on. If you can create a connection and operate the database normally in ODC, it indicates that Web ODC is deployed successfully. For more information about the use of Web ODC, see User Guide (Web ODC).
