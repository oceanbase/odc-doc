Deploy SSL certificate 
===========================================

When you log on to Web ODC in a browser over HTTP for the first time, you will receive a message indicating that the connection is not secure. To ensure access security, you can deploy an SSL certificate to access ODC over HTTPS. You can apply for a CA certificate or configure an HTTPS self-signed certificate. If you do not want to access ODC over HTTPS, you can skip this step and directly deploy NGINX. 

Apply for a CA certificate 
-----------------------------------------------

To apply for a CA certificate, we recommend that you purchase an SSL certificate and an SSL certificate service on Alibaba Cloud. For more information, see [SSL certificate](https://www.aliyun.com/product/cas). 

In the intranet environment, you can consult your IT administrator for the procedure of applying for a CA certificate.

Configure an SSL self-signed certificate 
-------------------------------------------------------------

The ODC image package contains an executable file that can generate a certificate and private keys: generate-odc-ssl-certificate.sh. You can run this file on the host to generate a certificate. The self-signed certificate can implement encrypted communication. However, an OS does not trust a self-signed certificate by default. You can add the certificate to the **Trusted Root Certificate Authorities** in the browser to configure certificate trust. 

The following code shows how to run the executable file. The value for `domain` must be consistent with the domain name used by your ODC. Otherwise, the browser considers that the certificate does not match the site.

```shell
$./generate-odc-ssl-certificate.sh
Enter your domain [www.example.com]:
Enter your province [Zhejiang]:
Enter your city [Hangzhou]:
Enter your company name [OceanBase]:
Enter your company unit name [DBA]:
generate certificate...

The following code shows the content of the generate-odc-ssl-certificate.sh file. You can directly run the following command to generate a self-signed certificate. 

```unknow
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# for generate self certificated ssl certificate files

echo try create directory '/etc/pki/nginx' if not exists...
sudo mkdir -p /etc/pki/nginx
cd /etc/pki/nginx || exit

    -out /etc/pki/nginx/odcserver.crt \
    -subj "${SUBJ}"

echo "check generated files (use ls -l odcserver.*):"
ls -l odcserver.*
```
