Create a private connection 
================================================





Overview 
-----------------------------

After you log on to the homepage of OceanBase Developer Center (ODC), you can click **Create Connection** in the upper-right corner of the **Private Connection** tab to create a private connection.

After you create the connection, you can view the saved database connection in the connection list on the ODC homepage.

> **Notice**  
> <li> In ODC V2.3.0 and later, the root@sys user permissions are required to query views when you use the import and export features. Therefore, to use the import and export features, you need to set the root@sys user in the Advanced Configuration section during connection creation.</li>
> <li> In ODC since V2.4.1, the dependency of the import and export feature on the root@sys user is removed when you query views.</li>
> <li> However, the root@sys user permissions are still required to view the partition information. Therefore, you must set the root@sys user in the Advanced Configuration section during connection creation.</li>
> <li> The Oracle connection mode is designed to share sessions. In this mode, when you actively commit or roll back a transaction, or trigger a transaction commit or rollback by creating, modifying, or deleting a database object or by executing a DDL statement, the transaction commit or rollback takes effect in all windows. When you enter a connection in Oracle mode for the first time, a reminder is displayed.</li>
> <li> In manual-commit mode, make sure to set the `ob_trx_idle_timeout` parameter to a value greater than or equal to the timeout value of SQL queries. Otherwise, if two SQL statements in one transaction are executed at an interval longer than the value of the `ob_trx_idle_timeout` parameter, the connection is terminated. However, if the `ob_trx_idle_timeout` parameter is set to an excessively large value, the session cannot be released in time, resulting in unnecessary memory consumption. Therefore, you must set this parameter to a proper value.</li>

  




Procedure 
------------------------------

Perform the following steps to create a connection:

1. Log on to ODC and click **Create Connection** in the upper-right corner of the **Private Connection** tab.

   

2. In the Create Connection panel, specify the fields described in the following table. If you have an OceanBase connection string, which follows the mysql -h **\<host name\>** -P **\<port number\>** -u **\<database username@tenant name\>** # **\<cluster name\>** -D **\<default database\>** -p ' **\<database password\>** ' format, you can obtain the information from the string. You can also paste the string in the field of Intelligent Parsing on the panel to automatically populate the corresponding fields.

   | Default Database        | When you connect to a database in a MySQL tenant, you must specify the default database for the connection.  You do not need to specify this field when you connect to a database in an Oracle tenant.  **Note**  If you leave this parameter unspecified, the information_schema database is connected by default.  However, if the connection to the information_schema database fails, you need to specify a database that the current user has access permissions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

You do not need to enter the database password each time you use the connection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
   | Intelligent Parsing     | You can paste a connection string to the field. ODC automatically identifies the string and fills in the corresponding fields on the page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
   | SQL Query Timeout Value | You can specify a timeout value for SQL queries. A query whose execution time exceeds the timeout value is automatically terminated. The default timeout value is 60 seconds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
   | Query sys Tenant View   | You can specify an account that has the permission to query the sys tenant view, and the password. This field is automatically populated when **Tenant** in **Endpoint** is set to sys.  * **Account** : an account that has the privilege to check the views under the sys tenant.   * **Password** : the password of the account.    After you specify the account and password, click **Test Connection** next to the password field to verify whether the account information is valid.  **Note**  * In ODC V2.3.0 and later, to use the import and export features, you need to configure the root@sys account in the Advanced Configuration section during connection creation.   * In ODC since V2.4.1, the dependency of the import and export feature on the root@sys user is removed when you query views.    |

   

3. Click **Save** to save the current configuration in the ODC connection list. Next time you log on to ODC, you can directly select the connection from the list. The connection configuration does not necessarily need to pass the connection test when you save the configuration.

   

4. Click **Copy Connection String** in the lower part of the panel to copy the connection information being edited on the current panel as a connection string if necessary. This allows you to obtain the connection information with ease.

   

5. Click **Cancel** if you do not need to save the current connection configuration. Then, a confirmation dialog box appears.
