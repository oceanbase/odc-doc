Log on to ODC with an account 
==================================================

During logon to OceanBase Developer Center (ODC), a user is identified by a logon account. The account is needed for subsequent operations such as configuring database connections and saving SQL scripts in the workspace. 

Go to the logon page of ODC, as shown in the following figure. Enter the registered account and password on the logon page and click **Log On** to go to the ODC homepage.

The Connections page automatically appears. The current account is displayed in the upper-right corner of the top navigation bar. You can click the account name and select **Log Off** from the drop-down list to return to the logon page. Then, you can log on to ODC with another account.
