The following table describes the recommended environment for installing the ODC client.


|      Environment      |                                                  Requirements                                                   |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Operating system (OS) | Windows: Win 7/Win10 Mac: 10.13.6 (17G65)                                                       |

| Port number           | Thanks to the dynamic port detection technology, you do not need to reserve port 8989 for ODC V2.3.0 and later. |
| CPU                   | 64-bit x86 processor, dual core or above                                                                        |

Account management 
---------------------------------------

To change your account password in ODC, log on to ODC, find your username in the upper-right corner of the top navigation bar.

Click the username and select **Change Password** .

Database connection 
----------------------------------------

* Oracle connections are designed to share one session. Whether you commit or roll back a transaction, or trigger a transaction either by creating, modifying, or deleting a database object, or by executing a DDL statement, the transaction takes effect on all windows.

  

* In manual-commit mode, make sure to set `ob_trx_idle_timeout` to a value greater than the timeout value of SQL queries. Otherwise, if two SQL statements in one transaction are executed at an interval longer than the value of `ob_trx_idle_timeout`, the connection will be terminated. However, if `ob_trx_idle_timeout` is set to an excessively large value, the session cannot be released in time, resulting in unnecessary memory consumption. Therefore, you need to set this parameter to a proper value.

  




Workspace 
------------------------------

* The anonymous block window is available only in Oracle mode.

  

* The debugging feature is unavailable when you use OBProxy to connect to an instance. Connect to the target instance directly in ODC.

  

* You have installed the debugging packages such as DBMS_DEBUG and DBMS_OUTPUT in the connected database.

  

* PL object debugging is supported only when OBServer V2.2.70, V3.0.00, or later is connected. Kernel debugging is supported only in an x86 architecture.

  

* In ODC, multiple identical connections share one single session. In ODC V2.3.2 and above, automatic committing is disabled by default for the Oracle mode. You must manually commit transactions. You can modify the value of the autocommit parameter on the **Session Properties** page to change this setting. For more information, see [Session management](../7.client-odc-user-guide/9.client-odc-session-management.md).

  




Data import and export 
-------------------------------------------

* OceanBase V2.2.30 and later versions support the following character sets: UTF8, GBK, GB18030, and UTF16. Instances earlier than OceanBase V2.2.30 only support UTF8.

  

* In ODC V2.2.0 and later, you can use the import and export feature when the target instance is directly connected to ODC or by using OBProxy.

  

* The maximum size of data exported in one batch in Web ODC cannot exceed 2 GB before compression. To export data of a larger size, use the data export tool OBDUMPER.

  

* The maximum size of files imported in one batch in Web ODC cannot exceed 2 GB after compression. To import data of a larger size, use the data import tool OBLOADER.

  

* ODC allows you to run up to three import or export tasks in parallel. Subsequent tasks will wait in the queue.

  

* In ODC V2.4.1 and later, you can use the sys tenant account to accelerate the import and export tasks. To export objects other than tables and views, you must configure the sys tenant account.

  




Database objects 
-------------------------------------

* Currently, you cannot modify indexes that are already created in a table.

  

* You can only create sequence and package objects in Oracle mode.

  

* The sys user has the read permission to view partition information. You need to set the sys user in Advanced Configuration during connection creation.
