#docslug#/oceanbase-developer-center/odc/V3.3.1/product-features
OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) is an enterprise-grade database development platform tailored for OceanBase Database. It supports both MySQL and Oracle modes of OceanBase Database and provides database developers with features such as database development, WebSQL-based workspace, SQL diagnostics, session management, and data import and export. 

Manage database connections 
------------------------------------------------

ODC allows you to connect to database instances in MySQL or Oracle mode of OceanBase Database. After you enter the required information on the connection creation page of ODC, you can test the connection and save the connection configuration. ODC allows you to save the connections to multiple databases. 

On the homepage of ODC, the Connections section displays the connections that you created and saved. You can open, edit, copy, and delete a saved connection.

Workspace 
------------------------------

ODC provides a WebSQL-based workspace where you can edit and diagnose SQL and PL/SQL statements. 

* In the SQL window of the workspace, you can run and save your SQL scripts.

  

* In the anonymous block window, you can edit, run, debug, and save anonymous blocks.

  

* The workspace also provides diagnostics information, such as execution details and execution results, in the corresponding tabs.

  

* You can also use the Snippets feature to search for and save the frequently used command code.![Image 174](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/9846960461/p241286.png)

  




Create and manage database objects 
-------------------------------------------------------

Object creation and management is a common task in database development. In ODC, you can create and manage database objects such as tables, views, functions, stored procedures, sequences, triggers, types, and synonyms. 

In addition to object creation and management by using SQL statements, ODC provides a concise and clear visualized interface where you can create objects and manage their properties.

Session management and properties 
------------------------------------------------------

A session is a connection between an application and a database. On the Session Management tab, you can view the details about all sessions of a database. 

The Session Properties tab of ODC provides a visualized interface where you can view and modify the session variables and global variables that the current database supports.

Data import and export 
-------------------------------------------

To make database maintenance easier, ODC supports importing and exporting a single table or multiple tables. You can export files in SQL and CSV formats and import SQL files and ZIP packages of files in SQL or CSV format. 

* ODC allows you to select multiple tables to import or export their data at a time.

  

* You can also import or export the data of a single table.![Image 622.png](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/9846960461/p175961.png "Image 622.png")

  






Command-line window 
----------------------------------------

The OceanBase client (OBClient) is the recommended command-line client for OceanBase Database. 

As a graphical user interface (GUI) development tool for OceanBase Database, ODC integrates OBClient in the form of a command-line window. The command-line window allows you to use command lines to develop and manage database features without downloading and installing OBClient. 

You can execute SQL or PL/SQL statements and view the execution results in real time. You can also use the `SOURCE` command to run files uploaded to your servers.

Data mocking 
---------------------------------

ODC provides the data mocking feature that can generate data based on field types in a table. This can meet your requirement for a large amount of data during database performance tests or feature verification. 

ODC generates data based on the field types and rules that you specified in the Mock Data panel.
