# What's New

OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) V3.4.0 released in September 2022 provides the following new features: logon verification code, dark theme, data desensitization, application and approval of permissions on public resources, and OAuth 2.0 authorization. The new version optimizes features such as import and export, result set, table object management, and session status labeling.

## Updated modules and features

| Feature | Module | Description |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Verification code mechanism | [Account logon](../6.web-odc-user-guide/1.log-on-to-odc/1.log-on-to-odc-account.md) | The verification code mechanism is provided on the logon page of web ODC.  |
| GUI updates | [ODC homepage](../6.web-odc-user-guide/2.web-odc-homepage.md) | The ODC console supports smooth switch between the default theme and the dark theme. <br>The new dark theme displays content with a reconstructed color scheme to highlight icons. This helps you focus on operations and reduces eye irritation caused by prolonged gaze at a bright light source.  |
| Data desensitization | [Data desensitization management](../6.web-odc-user-guide/4.web-odc-public-resource-management/6.web-odc-desensitization-rules.md)<br> [Result tab](../6.web-odc-user-guide/5.web-odc-use-workspace/2.web-odc-sql-window.md)<br> [Batch export and import](../6.web-odc-user-guide/6.web-odc-use-tools/1.web-odc-data-export-and-import/3.web-odc-batch-export-and-import.md) | ODC supports static data desensitization and allows you to enable data desensitization strategies in operations such as data export and result set export. <br>For example, ODC supports built-in desensitization rules for data such as email addresses, bank card numbers, phone numbers, ID card numbers, and names. You can configure desensitization strategies based on the valid range of `database name.table name.field name` specified by the desensitization rules. <br>ODC also allows you to configure custom desensitization rules by using desensitization algorithms such as masking, character replacement, format retaining, hashing, rounding, and null value assignment.  |
| Application and approval of permissions on public resources | [Permission application tasks](../6.web-odc-user-guide/9.web-odc-task-management/6.web-odc-apply-for-permissions-task.md) <br> [Task process management](../6.web-odc-user-guide/4.web-odc-public-resource-management/4.web-odc-task-process.md) | A general user can apply to the administrator of the public resource console for the permission to use a public connection.  After the user creates a public connection permission application task in the task center, the administrator can approve the task on the **Task Process Management** page of the public resource console. The user can view the task information and approval status in the task list of the task center. |
| Import and export | [Batch export and import (web ODC)](../6.web-odc-user-guide/6.web-odc-use-tools/1.web-odc-data-export-and-import/3.web-odc-batch-export-and-import.md) <br> [Batch export and import (ODC client)](../7.client-odc-user-guide/5.client-odc-use-tools/1.client-odc-data-export-and-import/3.client-odc-batch-export-and-import.md) | <li> The import and export settings page is upgraded from configuration on a single page to wizard-based configuration, which provides step-by-step guidance. </li> <li> Whole database export is supported. During partial export, you can select multiple objects to export at a time. In addition, the ODC client no longer limit the size of data to be exported. </li> <li> The exported content can be desensitized based on desensitization strategies. You can configure custom desensitization strategies as needed to ensure data security. </li> |
| Result sets | [Result tab](../6.web-odc-user-guide/5.web-odc-use-workspace/2.web-odc-sql-window.md) | <li> When you execute multiple SQL statements in an SQL window, if an error is reported for an SQL statement, the problematic row is highlighted, and an alert icon is displayed on the log tab to inform you about the error. For more information, see [Logs tab](../6.web-odc-user-guide/5.web-odc-use-workspace/2.web-odc-sql-window.md). </li>   <li> The display of SQL execution results is optimized. For example, numbers are right-aligned, and other types of data are left-aligned. Built-in adaptive rules based on the data type and length of the field are used.  </li>  <li> When you edit a result set, you can add a new row beneath the specified row. After you submit an SQL statement for confirmation, the generated SQL statement is formatted for display so that you can view lengthy clauses.  </li>  <li> When you export the result set of a query, you can desensitize the exported data and specify the number of exported data rows. If you export data in CSV format, the exported CSV file can be opened by Microsoft Excel. If you export data in XLS format, you can specify whether to include the column header and whether to export the SQL statements of the query. </li> |
| Table objects | [Table creation](../6.web-odc-user-guide/11.web-odc-database-objects/1.web-odc-table-objects/2.web-odc-create-a-table.md) | The procedure of table creation is more interactive. <li> For example, you can drag columns, copy rows, reorder rows, and double-click a cell to edit it. </li>   <li> Capabilities for table creation, such as setting virtual columns, expressions, index types, and visibility, and configuration of other attributes of a field, such as the character set, symbol selection, and automatic date update, are migrated from the kernel to the ODC console. </li>   <li> The following table creation rules are added based on the table management syntax: 1. If you do not create a column when you create a table, you are prompted that you cannot create the table. 2. A field is automatically generated with the default length based on the field type. 3. An auto-increment column can be reset to a regular column, but not vice versa. 4. Exclusion between column attributes is internally set. For example, no default values can be set for an auto-increment column. </li> |
| Session status labeling | [SQL editing area](../6.web-odc-user-guide/5.web-odc-use-workspace/2.web-odc-sql-window.md) | If you hover the pointer over the SQL window tab, the window name and execution status are displayed.  |
| System integration | [OAuth 2.0 authorization](../10.system-integration/2.oauth2-account-integration-guide/1.oauth2-overview.md) | This version supports ODC logon from an Apereo Central Authentication Service (CAS) server that supports the OAuth 2.0 protocol. After you register ODC with the authorization server, you can log on to the ODC homepage from the authorization page.  |
